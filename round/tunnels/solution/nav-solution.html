<p>The layout of the Tunnels is the same as the graph presented on the round page for the Tunnels. Red crow statues and green gargoyle statues in the Tunnels are located at the red and green nodes of the graph. Each puzzle corresponds to a node on that graph, and there is a skeleton at that node in the Tunnels who we can talk to once the puzzle is available to unlock it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is not so easy to get to the skeletons, because there are scary and dangerous ghosts in the way! Each edge of the graph has three lines of ghosts which float by, and we must pass through a ghost in each line to get to the other side. Each ghost has a word or string above it, and each edge has a rule for those strings which determines which ghosts will turn green and let us pass through them, and which will turn red and send us back to the beginning of the edge. Some trial and error is needed to determine the rule for each edge; the complete list of rules is below.</p>
