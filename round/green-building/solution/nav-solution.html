<p>As the &ldquo;Helpful Fellow&rdquo; in the lobby of the Green Building states, the elevator is a little weird. Instead of its buttons having numbers, they have colors (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Black, Gray, White, and Brown). There is also a button that takes us directly to the Ground floor. Each colored button also has an associated symbol which is used both for color-blind accessibility and for one of the navigation puzzles.</p>
<p>This is the button layout:</p>

<p>On each floor, there is a small puzzle encoding the elevator code for the floor immediately above it. </p>
