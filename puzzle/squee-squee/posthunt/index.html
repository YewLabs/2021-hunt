  <p>During the hunt, teams received a physical puzzle involving a piggy bank. Below is the virtual version of this puzzle.</p>
</div>

<h2>1. Unboxing</h2>

<p>“Squeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!”<br>
<i>Waaaaaaaaahoooooooooo I’m finally outta that tiny box!</i></p>

<p>A tiny pig hops from its US-mail-system wrappings out onto the surface of your desk. It begins to run small, tight circles, evidently quite happy to stretch its feet after a long journey. Congratulations! You are now a proud pig parent!</p>

<p>“Squee squee”<br>
<i>I may be a pig, but I like solving puzzles too, you know.</i></p>

<p>The little pig is making itself at home among the puzzlehunt detritus strewn about your desk. What is your pig’s pronoun and name?</p>
<p>Suggested names (these are not part of the puzzle. Feel free to pick whatever name you like):<br>
Boaris, Hamanda, Hamlet, Hammy Swinehouse, Little Hoof, Pignacio, Sir Francis Bacon, The Baconator, Trufflesnuffler</p>
