PLAYER: I've failed.
I was too tense. I overthought it...
Too much pressure to do well...
I was on pace for a medal, too. For the first time.
But I had to crash into the wall out of the first turn and screw it all up...
I feel awful...
Coach is trying to call me, but I'm not picking up.
I don't want to hear her voice right now.

So I took a taxi into the city...
It's nice to be by myself.
Wait...
Is that...?

JURGEN [hidename]: Well met.
PLAYER: (...Jurgen!)
(I didn't expect to see you here...)

> music resume
> show jurgen_neutral.png
JURGEN: Yes, well, I booked myself a hotel here.
I enjoy larger cities.
And...solitude often appeals to me more than the company of lugers.
Would you like to walk together?

> background none
PLAYER: Jurgen and I walked for a while in silence.

> background jurgensnowbg.png
> show jurgen_neutral.png
JURGEN: Thank you for today.
I always convince myself that being alone is more relaxing than being with someone.

> show jurgen_happy.png
But then I remember...how pleasant it can be with the right person.
It was nice to talk to you.

...Ah. I scheduled my flight for a few days from now.
If you'd be interested in meeting again...

It was nice to run into him today.

I wish I could get to know him better...

Ah, a restaurant?
That sounds lovely. I've wanted to sample the local cuisine.
Until tomorrow, then.

JURGEN: *nods* Perhaps a hedonistic choice, but I see the appeal.

WAITER: Very good. I'll be back with your meals shortly.


PLAYER: So do you have any hobbies? Besides luge, I mean.
> show jurgen_angry.png
JURGEN: Hmph. Are you saying that someone so focused on winning must not have hobbies?
PLAYER: (...)

> show jurgen_neutral.png
JURGEN: ...I apologize. That was crass.

> show jurgen_happy.png
Yes, I value having pursuits unrelated to one's main vocation. It makes one more well-rounded and interesting.
I occasionally write short stories, inspired by and built off of works I've enjoyed.
I try to post them on the internet in case others are interested.
PLAYER: (...Sounds like fanfiction to me.)
JURGEN: I do quite enjoy cooking as well. So it's delightful to travel so much and sample world cuisines.
I'm pleased you chose this restaurant. It is said to be quite good.

PLAYER: Glad you like it.

> background restaurant.png

WAITER: Can I get you two anything else tonight?
> show jurgen_happy.png
JURGEN: The food was excellent. Please give my compliments to the back of house.
WAITER: Certainly, sir. Would you like to see the dessert menu?

PLAYER: (What is this dish?)
WAITER: That is rye bread with cream cheese and jam. It's very delicious.
PLAYER: (Looks intriguing.)
> show jurgen_neutral.png
JURGEN: Very. Though I am quite full. Would you be willing to share?
PLAYER: Let's do it!

I would love to spend the day there with you.
Until tomorrow, then.

The next day...

> background park.jpg
> music day.ogg

PLAYER: It says here that this is a "catapult".
It's an elastic slingshot that propels you into the air and lets you free-fall.

> show jurgen_neutral.png
JURGEN: I am not interested.

PLAYER: But it looks so fun!
And it's fast! How can you be a luger and not like speed?

> show jurgen_angry.png
JURGEN: That...that is completely different!

> show jurgen_neutral.png
Luge has uncontrollable speed, yes...
But somehow, we mold it into something perfectly controllable.

> show jurgen_angry.png
But this! I have no desire to play-act a fall to my death.
PLAYER: Fine...

> background park.jpg
PLAYER: (I wanna go play paintball...)

> show jurgen_neutral.png
JURGEN: I'm not much for shooting guns.
PLAYER: Come on! You already skipped the catapult!
JURGEN: I am content to watch you play.
PLAYER: No. This time, you're coming with me.

> show jurgen_angry.png
JURGEN: Ugh...

> background park.jpg

> show jurgen_neutral.png
PLAYER: Geez, haha!
PLAYER: You might be the worst shot I've ever seen!

> show jurgen_angry.png
JURGEN: Hmph. That was the second time I've ever held a gun.

> show jurgen_neutral.png
Let us move on.

PLAYER: I'll bet you an ice cream that I can beat you at the archery range!

> show jurgen_happy.png
JURGEN: Is that so? Deal.
JURGEN: Ah, yes...I may have forgotten to mention that I was the under-12 archery champion in my region.
JURGEN: Good luck.

PLAYER: (Jurgen trounced me. 280 to 72...)
> background park.jpg
> show jurgen_neutral.png
JURGEN: Well...your form wasn't bad.
> show jurgen_happy.png
I must say, though, this is a delicious ice cream cone.
PLAYER: (He's just patronizing me...)

> background park.jpg

> show jurgen_neutral.png
JURGEN: It's been an eventful day.
JURGEN: Was there anything else you wanted to do before we go?
PLAYER: (No, I'm good.)
JURGEN: Then let us return to the hotel.

> show jurgen_happy.png
I must say, this amusement park was quite nice.
It's quaint. Nothing like the garish, corporate parks of America.
I had a good time today. Thank you.

Ah, exploring the town? An excellent idea.
The architecture here is beautiful. I would love to explore.
Until tomorrow, then.

PLAYER: The next day...

> music cold_sunny.ogg

> show jurgen_neutral.png
JURGEN: Nice to see you.
JURGEN: I got us both walking sticks.
PLAYER: (That's so thoughtful...)

JURGEN: This town is supposed to be known for these walking sticks. Peculiar, no?
JURGEN: I suppose people must hike frequently here.

> background church.jpg
> show jurgen_neutral.png
JURGEN: Ah, a church.
JURGEN: If you wouldn't mind, I'd like to go inside.

> background inchurch.png
> music hymn.ogg

> show jurgen_neutral.png
JURGEN: This brings back memories.
All churches are the same in a way, I suppose...
PLAYER: Are you religious?
JURGEN: I am not.
JURGEN: But I feel a certain kinship with religion.
I sang in the church choir while in school.
And it inspires me that religious faith can compel people to create such beautiful art.
Many people in my town were religious. Church was a gathering point for them.
I was not interested.
But a part of me wanted to be interested. So I could be part of their community.
Such is life, I suppose. One cannot control their beliefs.

JURGEN: ...Ah, a castle!
JURGEN: I've heard there are many in the area. It's impressively well maintained.

> show jurgen_neutral.png
JURGEN: Would you like to walk around the interior?
PLAYER: That sounds lovely.

> background castlegrounds.png

> show jurgen_neutral.png
JURGEN: Look, up on the parapet. It's an egret.
PLAYER: I didn't know you were into birds.
JURGEN: I used to birdwatch a lot as a child.
It was a good way to pass the time...and I could do it wherever I wanted, by myself.
I dived obsessively into a lot of things. Plants, astronomy, geography...
When I found something interesting, I wanted to know all about it.
And then one day I would suddenly lose all interest. And I would move on to something else.
PLAYER: I can see where you get that competitive spirit.
But then, when you're at the top...
When you're a luge world champion...
...will you just quit?
JURGEN: I can't know for sure, but once that happens, there's little else to do.
So I think I would.

JURGEN: Before I go, I have a small request of you.
JURGEN: Forgive me for my own...insecurities.
JURGEN: I like you quite a lot. But I want to know that you like me too.
JURGEN: Please permit me to ask a question, just to reassure myself.
PLAYER: Sure, go ahead.
