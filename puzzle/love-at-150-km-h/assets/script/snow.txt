NARRATOR: A few months later...

PLAYER: (Tomorrow is another competition.)
(I got up early so I can do some practice runs.)
(Thank goodness. The Denny's next door doesn't have a line yet!)
(Time to head out.)

PLAYER: (That piano music is so soothing!)
(I'd better go grab some breakfast before the line!)
(But I'm really enjoying this music...)

SNOW [hidename]: Hey.
Have you been there for the past three hours?

PLAYER: Huh? No, I've only been here a few minutes...

> sound TEMP_realization.ogg
Oh gosh, it HAS been three hours?!
I've just been...you're such a passionate player and...
PLAYER: Wait, Snow?!

Snow: Haha, I knew you looked familiar.
You were at that luge competition a few months ago, right?
Snow: Well anyway, I'm about to go get some breakfast. Bye!

What the heck. Sure! Let's do it!
I'll bring you to my favorite restaurant in town.

> show snow_happy.png
Snow: Here we are!
PLAYER: (I didn't expect your favorite restaurant to be only a couple blocks away from the hotel...)

> show snow_neutral.png
Snow: There aren't many luge tracks with upscale dining options.
PLAYER: Are you a big foodie?
Snow: Yeah, I love gourmet food.
But between luge practice and piano practice, I usually don't have time for it.
Opportunities like this where I happen to be near a good restaurant are a real treat.
PLAYER: What's your favorite dish on the menu?

> show snow_happy.png
Snow: The steak sandwich, for sure. It's so juicy, and the toasted bun is perfect.

> background restaurant_snow.jpg

> show snow_surprised.png
PLAYER: I can't believe I was listening to you play for so long!
PLAYER: I wanted to get in some practice before the track got crowded...
PLAYER: I guess that didn't really work out.
Snow: I'm guessing you're a fan of classical music?
PLAYER: Not exactly...you're just really good.

> show snow_happy.png
Snow: I actually started playing the piano on the same day I bought my first luge.
PLAYER: Wow! So are you as much a pianist as a luger?

> show snow_neutral.png
SNOW: Don't be silly, luge is my life.
I can see why you might think that. I've been practicing a lot recently.
It's 'cause there's a big classical piano competition later this year. Happening right here.
It has one of the biggest prizes in classical music.
I'm really hoping to win it, to help pay for all the luge competitions.

PLAYER: So, were you practicing in the lobby for the competition?
Or was that just one of your favorites?

SNOW: Yeah, I was practicing a competition piece.
I actually don't listen to much classical in my free time.
PLAYER: No kidding!
> show snow_happy.png
SNOW: Yeah. I actually like rock music a lot.
My favorite song for 20 years has been YYZ.
It always hypes me up before luge runs.
Speaking of which, I should head over to the course!
Maybe I'll see you there later?
PLAYER: Yeah, looking forward to it!

SNOW: Oh hey! I was so focused that I didn't see you there.
How are you settling in?
PLAYER: I'm doing great! I'm here for the competition later today!
Snow: Oh, me too! I can't wait.
Luge always gets my blood pumping.
Anyway, good to see you again! I'm from the area, so it's like being home.

> show snow_neutral.png
You have my number, right? Give me a call if you need anything.
But if you don't mind, I should get back to practicing...

Snow: Oh, a date...let's do it!
I need to finish my practice, and grab my toque, but meet me here in an hour.
I know somewhere we can go before the competition...

> background cars_outside.jpg
Snow: Right this way! Here's my car!	
PLAYER: Where are we going?
Snow: It's a surprise! You'll see soon!

Snow: We're here!

> show snow_neutral.png
PLAYER: Wow! A...
...paleontology museum?
> show snow_happy.png
Snow: Yeah! I came here years ago and I really like it.

> show snow_neutral.png
I've always wanted to come back.
PLAYER: I don't know that much about paleontology...

> show snow_happy.png
Snow: Don't worry! The whole point of a museum is to teach you cool things.
Let's go check it out!

> background museum_water.png
> music recollection.ogg

> show snow_neutral.png
PLAYER: Wow. It's like we're under the sea, but with giant skeletons.

> show snow_happy.png
Snow: Yeah, I know!

> show snow_neutral.png
This would be a neat place to come on Halloween...
PLAYER: Is this really how big they were?
Snow: Actually, I think these models are blown up to be a lot bigger.
So that you can see the creatures better.
PLAYER: Thank goodness.
If this were the real size of this guy's mouth, he'd swallow me whole...
Snow: This plaque says everything displayed here was found in a single fossil bed, just 200 miles west!
Can you believe so many creatures were so close by?
PLAYER: Maybe they were here for the luge.

> show snow_happy.png
Snow: Ha! Yeah, I imagine so!
Come on, let's go to the next room.

> background museum_fossils.png

> show snow_neutral.png
Snow: In this room they show off their most prized fossils!
PLAYER: Wow, look at this one! It's so big!
Snow: Yeah! The museum researchers keep the fossils they're working on in here, so we're seeing real scientific specimens up close.
PLAYER: Even that huge dinosaur there?

> show snow_happy.png
Snow: Actually, that one was 3D printed!
> show snow_neutral.png
Its bones were too fragile to be cast like most of the other bones in the museum, so they digitized and printed it instead.
PLAYER: You know so much about paleontology!
PLAYER: You must have loved science class in school.
Snow: Yeah. I did like science...
Snow: But geography class was always my favorite.
Snow: I'm really lucky that, as a luge athlete, I get to travel all over the world!

> background museum_dinos.png

PLAYER: Finally! A room with nothing but dinosaurs!
> show snow_happy.png
Snow: Yeah, this is my favorite too.
PLAYER: Look at this guy's teeth.
> show snow_surprised.png
Snow: But he has such small arms and hands!
PLAYER: It'd be tough for him to push off at the start of a luge course.
> show snow_happy.png
Snow: I don't think he'd even fit on a sled!
PLAYER: Maybe he can just run down the course faster than a luge.
...Would that even count?
> show snow_neutral.png
Snow: Actually, a luge travels 5 times faster than a T-Rex.
PLAYER: You can't beat a luger that easily, T-Rex!

> background outside_museum.jpg

> show snow_happy.png
Snow: This has been great!
I think we should head back to the course now, though.
PLAYER: Yeah this was awesome! Not what I was expecting at all. But I liked it.

PLAYER: (Even though I got here early, the line is so long...)
PLAYER: (Good thing they serve their customers so fast.)
PLAYER: (I wish I could luge as fast as Denny's serves its customers.)
PLAYER: (...I'm finally near the front.)
PLAYER: I'll have the Moons Over My Hammy.

SNOW [hidename]: Whoa! What happened?
PLAYER: Oh my gosh, I wasn't paying attention, and I tripped on the piano!
SNOW [hidename]: Thank goodness the food didn't get in the piano! That could have been a disaster.
PLAYER: I got the cheese all over my luge uniform!

> show snow_neutral.png
SNOW [hidename]: Luge? Wait...
SNOW: Hey, I've seen you before!
PLAYER: Oh, Snow! It's you!

> show snow_happy.png
> music day.ogg
Snow: Hey, you! How are you doing?
PLAYER: Well...I would be doing better if I didn't have cheese all over my uniform.

> show snow_neutral.png
Snow: Sorry about that.
Not exactly sure how you tripped over the piano while I was playing it...
Was I playing too quietly for you to notice...?
PLAYER: What? No! You were incredible!
Really, I just wasn't watching my step.
Snow: That sandwich looks amazing.
PLAYER: Oh yeah, Denny's has the best stuff.
Snow: Man, now I'm hungry...
PLAYER: How about I get you one?
Snow: Wow, that'd be great.

> show snow_happy.png
Snow: How about this: buy me a sandwich from Denny's, and I'll take you to a cleaner I know nearby.

> choice
| Like a breakfast date? snow3_yes

Let's meet over at Denny's.

> show snow_surprised.png
Snow: Wow it sure is crowded in here!

> show snow_neutral.png
PLAYER: Yeah, Denny's has the best food.
Even out here near the luge track, looks like it's really popular.
Snow: What do you recommend?
PLAYER: Well I had a Moons Over My Hammy before. If that looks good to you, that's what I'd go for.

> show snow_happy.png
Snow: Right, I'll try one!

> background dennys.png

> show snow_neutral.png
Snow: So are you here for the tournament?
PLAYER: Yeah. I came early to practice before it starts.
Snow: That's a great idea! Practice makes perfect, you know.
PLAYER: But I'm not even good yet. I'll never be perfect.
I can't even eat a sandwich without getting it all over myself.

> show snow_happy.png
Snow: But that's the best part about luge!

> show snow_neutral.png
You can always go faster. You can always shave off another millisecond from your time.
Everyone's trying to be perfect. But perfection isn't even possible!
PLAYER: I never thought about it that way.
Maybe that's why I like luge so much.
Snow: Speaking of which, let's go get your uniform cleaned!

> background cars_outside.jpg

> show snow_neutral.png
PLAYER: So how do we get to the cleaner?
Snow: Actually, I thought we could go by bus.
The 408 bus makes a short loop through the neighborhood, then stops right by the cleaners.
PLAYER: Sounds like fun!

> background bus.png
> music day.ogg

> show snow_neutral.png
PLAYER: How long is this bus ride again?
Snow: Only about 15 minutes. We should be there soon.
PLAYER: Do you think they'll be able to clean my uniform today?
I'd really like it tomorrow for the competition. 
Snow: Oh yeah, they have really fast service.
Since we're so early, they'll be finished by 5pm.
PLAYER: How do you know so much about them?
Snow: Let's just say...this isn't the first time I've been through this.
One of my pals growing up was really into poutine...

> sound carrev.ogg
> background bus.png 1.0

> show snow_neutral.png
PLAYER: You were right, that was easy!
Snow: Yeah, this place is great! Your uniform will be ready in just a few hours.
Snow: The guy who runs it, Richard, and I, go way back. He was my next door neighbor growing up.
Snow: And thanks for the breakfast! I'll have to go to Denny's more often.
PLAYER: Maybe we can go again tomorrow!
Snow: Well, I'm not sure that's the best pre-competition food...
PLAYER: No, believe me, it is.
Snow: ...I'll think about it.
Well anyway, this is our stop!

Snow: Oh hey, you!
Snow: I had a great time hanging out today.
Snow: And I was thinking...I have a neat idea for something else we could do together.
Snow: But I'm a busy guy.
Snow: Between the luge and the piano, I don't have too much free time.
Snow: So I was thinking, I want to ask you a question. To make sure you really get me.
Snow: It's just one question, but it will really help me to decide.
