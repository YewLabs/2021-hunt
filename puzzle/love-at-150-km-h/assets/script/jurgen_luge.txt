JURGEN: Let's go.

JURGEN: You'll be on the bottom.
So you'll need to take care of steering.
I hope you know the course.

JURGEN: (I must be misreading...!)
I knew that was a good run, but...we clocked an incredible time.
We're just two seconds off the course record.
I think you and I must be meant for each other.

JURGEN: Hm. A decent time.
You performed well, but your inexperience shows.
You can do better. You didn't get all the turns.
In any case, this was fun. Thank you for obliging me.
I will see you soon.
