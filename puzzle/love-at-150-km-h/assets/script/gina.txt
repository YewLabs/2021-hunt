But I can't put on weight.
I'm cutting for the tournament tomorrow...

PLAYER: Not really...
We're both here for the tournament, right?

GINA: Ah! Good point!

PLAYER: My runs were in the morning.
I didn't place well. But I'm still improving, and this track was a really tough one.
And I think my neck is starting to toughen up.
My muscles feel way less sore than usual today.
I watched Gina's runs too...
She finished middle of the pack, but she was all smiles.
After the race, she looked like she had had the time of her life.

After the tournament...

PLAYER: You watched me...!

GINA: Uh, yeah? Why wouldn't I?
Oh, that reminds me. I gotta run.
It's my sister's birthday, so I should give her a call.
Oh! Hey, when's your flight home?

> show gina_happy.png
...It's two days from now? Me too!
Well, the competition's over now. I gotta find something to do...
Ooh, I can go exploring!
Yeah, maybe I will! I was hoping to see more of the country before I left...

GINA: Oh, neat! Have fun!
GINA: Ooh, yeah...there are so many good places to eat here.

GINA: Oh, come on. What do you take me for? I plan better dates than that...
GINA: There's a hot spring at the top!
GINA: I think it'll take all day to climb up there. We can take a nice, hot soak just as the sun sets...
GINA: Then we can take the bus back down and ride the subway home!
GINA: So let's get going! I got us water bottles from the vending machine!

GINA: So after a race, you have your own relaxation ritual, right?
GINA: Well, mine is a steaming cup of honey lavender tea.

GINA: Nothing beats the feeling of kicking back with a hot cup of tea and a tough crossword.

PLAYER: We finally made it to the hot springs, panting and sweating.
PLAYER: Nobody was using them, and Gina and I had them all to ourselves.
PLAYER: We showered and lowered ourselves into the warm mineral water, as the sun was starting to set...

GINA: Ahhhh...
GINA: It's like my worries are melting away...
GINA: The cold air and the hot water...
GINA: This is the best feeling ever.
GINA: Reminds me of being a kid.
GINA: Curling up by the fireplace in the wintertime, trying to stay warm...
GINA: It was rough. We didn't have much.
GINA: But looking back, I enjoyed it.
GINA: Makes me really appreciate what I have now.

GINA: I want to settle down somewhere cold.
GINA: There's nothing better than a hot bath on a cold winter night, you know?
GINA: Geez, this is so nice...I'm falling asleep...

GINA: Alright, let's do some air hockey!

You know, I used to be TERRIFIED of trains.
Back home, I was taking a train to a friend's place.
It was one of those older ones where you can go out onto the balcony.
We were leaving the station. I was leaning out, waving bye to my parents...
> show gina_happy.png
...and then I actually FELL over the side!
The train had to stop and everything! And I went to the hospital...
But I actually wasn't scared at all!
> show gina_neutral.png
I think something about me has always been drawn to thrills.
PLAYER: Glad everything was okay.
I can see why you're a luger.
> show gina_happy.png

Every single time I get on the track, I end up having an amazing day.
Luging has been a dream come true for me. I'm so grateful.
I get to travel the world. Have all sorts of adventures...

GINA: I try to talk to them, but they never really listen to me.
GINA: Everyone just thinks about luge for some reason!

GINA: But I want to have a life too, y'know?
