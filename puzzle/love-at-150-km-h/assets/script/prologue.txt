PLAYER: I love luge.
Ever since I was small, my dream has been to become a luge athlete.
After four years of hard work, I finally made it onto the national team.
And today...it's my first tournament.
Time to show the world what I can do.

SNOW [hidejustname]: What'cha up to?


> show snow_happy.png
That your sled? Pretty nifty...not bad, not bad!
You may want to take some weight off the runners, though.
This course has a bunch of sharp turns. Remember what happened last year?

> show snow_neutral.png
Oh! Forgot to introduce myself.
SNOW: Name's Snow. Good to meet ya!
I've been on the national team for 5 years running now.

> show snow_surprised.png
...Oh, that right? It's your first tournament?

> show snow_happy.png
Damn. Good for you! Great to see a new face!
Me, I'm going for the win this year.
I got second place last time. Ever since then I've been tinkering with my equipment.
And finally, I got it *just right*.

PLAYER: (Who was that?)

SNOW: Ah. Him.
He's an incredible luger. Doesn't really talk to anyone though.
Just shows up, does his thing, collects his medals, and leaves.
Think his name's...
...actually, I forgot.

Oh — gotta go! Cheer for me, would ya?

PLAYER: I watched Snow's first run...
PLAYER: It was flawless. He led the pack by a full quarter-second going into the afternoon...

> SHOW gina_surprised.png
GINA: What? Don't give me that look.

> SHOW gina_happy.png
Well, it's nothing to be ashamed of!
Don't you worry! We lugers are a small community.
You'll be up to your neck in friends before you know it!
Name's Gina. See you round!

JURGEN [hidename]: ...

PLAYER: (You're...)

> music cold_sunny.ogg
JURGEN: Yes?
PLAYER: Snow mentioned you.
He said you don't really talk to anyone.
JURGEN: I'm not much for people.

PLAYER: So you just fly all over the world, alone?
Aren't you friends with your teammates?
JURGEN: We are mutually courteous.
PLAYER: But isn't it more fun to luge with others?
> SHOW jurgen_angry.png
JURGEN: I think that unlikely.
Other people tend to hold me back.
> SHOW jurgen_neutral.png
I aim to be the best. Others don't take that goal as seriously.

PLAYER: The best...
But you got a silver today! Isn't that good enough?
Don't you enjoy the sport itself at all?
The turns, the wind, the speed! Doesn't it feel amazing?

> SHOW jurgen_neutral.png
JURGEN: Yes, and no.
Certainly, the arena of the luge track exemplifies human athleticism.
But the culture around the sport is quite muted.
None of us is remotely famous. Most do not even know what luge is.
The only time the public remembers we exist is during the Olympics.
> SHOW jurgen_angry.png
We cannot capture the public consciousness like so many others.
No glory or creature comforts await any of us at the top.
> SHOW jurgen_neutral.png
And yet, there are still those who give up everything to be the best.
Yes, you are a lamb among wolves...

> SHOW jurgen_happy.png
Truly, I admire your optimism. But you will see after a while.

> SHOW jurgen_neutral.png
There is little point in pursuing luge without becoming great.

PLAYER: Yes, there is.
I like it. And I met a lot of nice people already.
You don't need to be the best at everything.

> SHOW jurgen_angry.png
JURGEN: Hmph.
Then what is the point?

> SHOW jurgen_neutral.png
What use is there in this sport if you won't be remembered?

PLAYER: (I've wanted to be a luger ever since I was little.)
(After years of work, I'm finally getting what I wanted.)
(But Jurgen is right. Now is when the real work begins.)
(Will it be worth it?)
(I've put so many hours into this sport...)
(What else could I have become?)
(What can I still become?)

PLAYER: ...I don't think there always needs to be a use.
Really, I don't focus on it.
Things will work themselves out in the end.

> SHOW jurgen_angry.png
JURGEN: I see...
You'll never be a champion. But that's acceptable to you.

> SHOW jurgen_happy.png
For your sake, I hope you can hold on to your beliefs.
...Ah, I've talked too long. I have to go.
I am glad we could meet, though.
You have given me something to think about.
Goodbye. I am certain our paths will cross again.

PLAYER: It's late.
Coach said I did alright for my first tournament.
But I know she's just being nice.
I can do better.
I didn't move halfway across the world for nothing.

M [hidename]: Hey.
PLAYER: ...Who are you?

M [hidename]: There's no need for names.
You know who I am.

PLAYER: ...

M [hidename]: I can see it in your eyes.
You're searching. Searching for something.
An answer to a puzzle.
Don't give up.
You're close.
Just a little bit further.
