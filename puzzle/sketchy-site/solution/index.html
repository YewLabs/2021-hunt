<p>The puzzle contains 8 images that are assembled from Google Doodles, which are artistic reinterpretations of the Google logo on the homepage usually commemorating a person or event of significance, as well as 8 phrases that look like search queries.</p>

<p>To start, note that each image contains the left half of a Google Doodle, and the right half of another Google Doodle. The two halves together contain 5 of the 6 letters of &ldquo;GOOGLE&rdquo;, or at least symbols that correspond to letters via shape or color. This gives an index from 1 to 6 for the missing letter in-between, and also hints that there is a special Doodle between the two Doodles shown. Indeed, using the left-and-right navigation on <a href="https://www.google.com/doodles">https://www.google.com/doodles</a>, solvers can find that there is an interactive game Doodle between each pair of Doodles. To help with identification, the images are presented in chronological order based on the date when the Doodles were aired, and Doodles that aired separately in multiple countries have a flag symbol in the corner for disambiguation.</p>

<p>The list of Doodles is as follows:</p>

<p>To answer the search queries, solvers need to play the interactive Doodles to figure out which queries they are related to.</p>

<h2>Authorâ€™s Notes</h2>

<p>Seeing an interactive Google Doodle is often a delightful surprise, and Magic Cat Academy is my personal favorite. I wanted to give solvers an excuse to (re)play some of the most well-received Doodles. Initial versions of this puzzle had a much longer data collection step, but it was shortened once it became evident during testsolving that looking at static Doodles isn't nearly as fun as playing interactive Doodles (though some of the static ones are artistically interesting).</p>
