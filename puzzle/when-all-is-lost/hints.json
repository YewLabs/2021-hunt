[[10.0, ["start"], "These are cryptic crossword clues. A cryptic clue has a definition half and a wordplay half. In this puzzle, the two halves of each clue solve to different but related strings. You need to figure out how they're related, then solve each clue and fill the wordplay answers into the grid. The number after each clue is the length of its definition answer."], [20.0, ["clue"], "The answer to the wordplay half of each clue is derived from the answer to its definition half by removing certain letters. Each clue belongs to one of the six characters listed below the grid, and that character's number shows how many clues she has. The character's quote obliquely indicates which letters to remove for their clues."], [30.0, ["character", "letter"], "The letters each character removes are:\r\n\r\nElsa: -IT\r\nMoana: -HEART\r\nKatara: -HE\r\nMisty: -ALL\r\nMei: -MOVE\r\nJaina: -PEACE\r\n\r\nThe letters may be removed from anywhere in the answer, not necessarily in order, but the remaining letters do remain in order. If the letter appears multiple times in the answer, remove them one at a time. For example, LABELLED - ALL could give either BELED or LBEED."], [40.0, ["extract"], "The instruction that no cell is part of three or more answers is phrased in a way that suggests how to extract."], [50.0, ["extract"], "When you have filled in the grid, all the hexes that are unchecked (only part of one answer) form a path.
