<p>After sending the requested photos to HQ, solvers received an email which said, &ldquo;Yay! We&rsquo;re glad to know you&rsquo;re taking care of yourselves. Now, make sure you remember to eat dinner, and then submit an answer to let us know that you ATE DINNER!&rdquo; This clues solvers to enter the answer <span class="answer">ATE DINNER</span> (hopefully after actually doing so).</p>

<h2>Authorsâ€™ Notes</h2>
  <p>The title of this puzzle is based on a Twitch meme, referring to a bot that reminds users to drink water. Early in the writing process, one of the authors became known on the team for reminding everyone to do the same, and also for telling a particular team member to &ldquo;fix your shoulders.&rdquo; And so the idea for this puzzle was born. We had a very fun time testsolving it at one of our virtual retreats.</p>
