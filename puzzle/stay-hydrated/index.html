<p>This puzzle is here to remind you to take care of yourselves during Hunt. So sit up straight, drink some water, and stretch. Then send some pictures to HQ showing at least 5 total team members practicing self-care to find out what you have to do next. (If you&rsquo;re a small team and can&rsquo;t find that many, do your best.)</p>
