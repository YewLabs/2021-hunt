    We are additionally given a playlist as part of the shell. Given the name of the dorm, it seems natural to consider the <i>next</i> song in each album, as follows:
</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Song in playlist</th><th>Album</th><th>Next song</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Couch Potato</td><td>Poodle Hat</td><td>Hardware Store</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Over the Moon</td><td>Rent</td><td>La Vie Boh&egrave;me</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Television Rules the Nation</td><td>Human After All</td><td>Technologic</td></tr>
    <tr><td>That's Not Her Style</td><td>Storm Front</td><td>We Didn't Start the Fire</td></tr>
    <tr><td>The Bells of Rhymney</td><td>Mr. Tambourine Man</td><td>All I Really Want to Do</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Unchained</td><td>American II: Unchained</td><td>I've Been Everywhere</td></tr>
</table>

    These next songs are all list songs, a fairly common song format where a significant part of the lyrics consists of a long list of items. Each of the answers appears in one of these lists. We can sort the answers by their first letters, as they range from A-F. Reusing the name of the dorm, we can then take the next item in the list:
</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Answer</th><th>Song</th><th>Next item</th></tr>
    <tr><td><code>ANGLE BRACKETS</code></td><td>Hardware Store</td><td><code>DURACELLS</code></td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>BUDAPEST</code></td><td>We Didn't Start the Fire</td><td><code>ALABAMA</code></td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>CHASKA</code></td><td>I've Been Everywhere</td><td><code>NEBRASKA</code></td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>DEFY</code></td><td>All I Really Want to Do</td><td><code>CRUCIFY</code></td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>ENTROPY</code></td><td>La Vie Boh&egrave;me</td><td><code>EMPATHY</code></td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>FAX</code></td><td>Technologic</td><td><code>RENAME IT</code></td></tr>

    Looking at the first letters of the next items, we get DANCER, but this is not the answer. Instead, there is another prominent ordered list (sometimes sung to a song) containing the word DANCER - Santa's reindeer. The next item in <i>this</i> list, <span class="answer">PRANCER</span>, is the answer.
