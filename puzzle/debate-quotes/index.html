&ldquo;Sorry Steve, you can't blame this one on America.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Communication is what I'm talking about, Stephen.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Stephen, you can't make tea in space.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;But we can't help ourselves, Stephen, because humans are naturally inquisitive.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Stephen, I think it's time you turned a telescope on your own home life.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Stephen, Cuba's the last vestige of an evil empire.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Well isn't it obvious, Stephen?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Suck it up, Stephen!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;No, this is not about me, Steve, this is about a lonely little boy.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I love you, Steve.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Let's face it Steve, politics have become a bore.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Steve, stooping to the lowest common denominator isn't the answer.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;You're just proving my point, Steve.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Look, this is nothing new: Stephen Douglas once referred to Abraham Lincoln as a fussy scoundrel.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Just because it ended in 1898 is too easy an answer, Stephen.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That's as maybe some-evers, Stephen, but if freshness is your only requirement why not point the camera at a newly-minted turd?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Call me old fashioned, Steve, but I am a people person.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;The point is, Steve, the point is, not everything is worth watching.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Steve! What are you doing?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Stephen, I think we can both agree that what constitutes entertainment is in the eye of the beholder.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Stephen, let's not have this disintegrate into yet another series of personal attacks, okay fatty?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Steve, we've exhausted this topic.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Steve, all I can tell you is that it is terrible, it is horrible, it is imminent, and it only involves you.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Steve, the point is, in situations like this, the facts are just gonna terrify the public.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Steve, I was just giving an example.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But I suppose there are a few sick individuals out there who get off on other people's suffering, Steve.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Far out, Steve, groovy point man.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Let me in on the dirty little secret, Stephen.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Stephen, you're not listening to my argument.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Clear as crystal, Steve, but let me see if I can just recap your really twisted argument.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Steve, with great power comes great responsibility.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Steve, that's a stupid thing to say and you're a stupid person for saying it.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Well I'm not surprised that you would want to entangle the US in that quagmire Mr. Steven Carellenbergowitzteinishskiberg.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Finally, Stephen, should we change the way we talk?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Granted, but I'm afraid we can't just do that Stephen.&rdquo;
