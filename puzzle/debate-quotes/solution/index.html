<p>This puzzle consists of quotes from Even Stevphen, a recurring segment from The Daily Show from the early 2000s which featured Steve Carell and Stephen Colbert debating various topics. 
    Each group of five quotes comes from the same Even Stevphen segment, presented in the same order they appear in that segment. 
    Each quote mentions either &ldquo;Steve&rdquo; or &ldquo;Stephen&rdquo;, but in some quotes, the wrong name is given. 
    We can read each group as a letter in five-bit binary by treating correct quotes as a 1 and incorrect quotes as a 0 to spell the final answer <span class="answer">TINFOIL</span>.
