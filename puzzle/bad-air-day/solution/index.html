  Each of the boarding passes represents a fashion show that was unusual or
  notable, for a reason explained by the cancellation reason. The main clue
  towards this is that the set of "From" cities is Paris, New York, London,
  Milan, and Beijing, which includes the "Big Four" fashion capitals, and the
  dates match with their corresponding fashion weeks (January-March for
  autumn/winter shows and September-October for spring/summer shows). We also
  might directly recognize a particularly notable show like Fendi's Great Wall
  of China show or Alexander McQueen's hologram. The shows, in boarding pass
  order, are:

  The brands are in alphabetical order, which helps with identification and
  suggests that they are the relevant names to index into with the numbers on
  the planes.
</p>

<p>
  Each of the planes represents the first look in one of the above shows (or one
  of the first looks in cases where it's slightly ambiguous), where the wings
  represent arms and the "tail" (technically, the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stabilizer_(aeronautics)"
    >horizontal stabilizers</a
  >) represents legs. We use the number on the plane to index into the matching
  brand name:

  This spells out CATWALK FOR US. Submitting this phrase prompted teams to send
  us some of their best looks for a hypothetical puzzle-themed show. Upon doing
  this, teams received the answer <span class="answer">LIZ CLAIBORNE</span>.

<h2>Authorsâ€™ Notes</h2>

  <p>
    In case it wasn't clear, we used the airplane theming entirely for the
    purpose of making the "runway" pun (which is why we coyly used many synonyms
    of "runway" throughout the cancellation reasons). Though, I suppose "model"
    airplanes are also a thing...
  </p>

  <p>
    At some point during construction, we realized that out of the 19 potential
    shows we considered using, all 19 of them were for collections in even
    years! We wondered if there was some unspoken agreement in the fashion world
    to only do weird/ambitious shows every other year, but as far as we know
    this isn't actually a thing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some other shows we wanted to use but couldn't for various reasons include
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ar6TJYV0QE"
      >Rick Owens' spring/summer 2014 menswear</a
    >
    collection (featuring a metal band whose drummers constantly rotate upside
    down throughout the performance),
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TirA415R7o4"
      >Rick Owens' spring/summer 2014 ready-to-wear</a
    >
    (featuring collegiate stepping teams in lieu of models), and
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLw-hozWzpc"
      >Chanel's spring/summer 2012 ready-to-wear</a
    >
    (with Florence Welch emerging from a clamshell to perform "What the Water
    Gave Me").
