<p>This is a puzzle about five types of wordplay games: cryptics, printer&rsquo;s devilry, pure metas, puns, and straight (crossword) clues. Each clue in this puzzle has two parts: an &ldquo;inner clue&rdquo; which consists of a contiguous set of some words from the clue, and an &ldquo;outer clue&rdquo; which is the remaining unused words.</p>

<p>The inner clue solves via one of the five wordplay mechanisms to the name of one of the five types: CRYPTIC, PRINTERSDEVILRY, META, PUN, or STRAIGHT. This gives the type of the outer clue. The outer clue can then be solved to a normal English word. These outer clue answers are alphabetically sorted, which should help with solving and confirmation. (You can see full answers to the inner/outer clues at the bottom of this page.)</p>

<p>There are 25 clues, and in fact each of the 25 pairs of clue types appears exactly once as inner/outer clue types. This suggests that we put the words in a 5&times;5 grid based on (inner type, outer type). Doing this with the proper orientation, five new clues appear along the rows. Here the rows and columns order the clue types alphabetically. This may not be the first way that solvers put the words into a grid, but related words should jump out enough so that the table is reordered to make phrases (SEX-LINKED and GENE, MOVIE and ROLE, etc).</p>

<table>
    <tr><th></th><th>cryptic</th><th>meta</th><th>printer&rsquo;s devilry</th><th>pun</th><th>straight</th></tr>
    <tr><th>cryptic</th><td>SEX-LINKED</td><td>GENE</td><td>STORES</td><td>SECRET</td><td>ADVANTAGE</td></tr>
    <tr><th>meta</th><td>TESTED</td><td>DEADLOCKS</td><td>SHINS</td><td>FEET</td><td>DOG-EARS</td></tr>
    <tr><th>printer&rsquo;s devilry</th><td>RONALDO</td><td>SCORES</td><td>WITHER</td><td>OVER</td><td>DEFENSE</td></tr>
    <tr><th>pun</th><td>ON</td><td>VACATION</td><td>AND</td><td>SMASHING</td><td>THINGS</td></tr>
    <tr><th>straight</th><td>STARRING</td><td>MOVIE</td><td>ROLE</td><td>OR</td><td>CLUE</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Finally, the five new clues should be solved as clues of their appropriate type (the inner type, which is common to all words in the clue). The solutions are (again, taken in alphabetical-by-clue-type order)</p>

<table>
    <tr><th>Clue type</th><th>Clue</th><th>Answer</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>
    <tr><td>cryptic</td><td>Sex-linked gene stores secret advantage</td><td>EDGE</td><td>Hidden word: sex-linkED GEne</td></tr>
    <tr><td>meta</td><td>TESTED, DEADLOCKS, SHINS, FEET, DOG-EARS</td><td>BARELY</td><td>Exactly one way to insert a letter and create a new word: TESTBED, DREADLOCKS, SHINES, FLEET, DOG-YEARS. The added letters are BRELY. &ldquo;Do it again&rdquo; to get BARELY.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>printer&rsquo;s devilry</td><td>Ronaldo scores wither over defense</td><td>AHEAD</td><td>Ronaldo scores with [A HEAD]er over defense</td></tr>
    <tr><td>pun</td><td>On vacation and smashing things</td><td>BREAKING</td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>straight</td><td>Starring movie role or clue</td><td>LEAD</td><td></td></tr>
</table>

<p>Taken together, these five words match the enumeration given at the bottom of the puzzle: EDGE BARELY AHEAD BREAKING LEAD (5). This is a final cryptic clue, and the final answer to the puzzle is <span class="answer">BLADE</span> = Edge / B_ + LADE*.

<h2>Author’s Notes</h2>
    <p>I&rsquo;m pretty happy with how this puzzle turned out. The progression of insights on the way to a solve seemed solid and steady (first the break-in with identifying probably a cryptic or maybe the Greek letters meta, then &ldquo;what are the five clue types?&rdquo;, then realizing &ldquo;huh we need a printer&rsquo;s devilry inside a printer&rsquo;s devilry somewhere, how is that even possible&rdquo;, then using the 5&times;5 grid to polish off the last few tough clues). The fact that for many of the clues you already knew the answer (well, or at most 5 options) makes solving these clues feel exciting. Hopefully you saw how ugly the phrases were, said &ldquo;this looks terrible&rdquo;, proceeded to solve the puzzle, and then decided &ldquo;wow, that was fun!&rdquo;</p>
    <p>If I could do it again, the final cluephrase could be improved. I couldn&rsquo;t think of an interesting, easy extraction method so I defaulted to a cryptic clue. But even then, testsolvers pointed out that <i>every word</i> in the cluephrase is a cryptic indicator, which is just needlessly intricate. A clearer cryptic is &ldquo;Urinary sacs avoid doctor&rsquo;s scalpel&rdquo; (BLADDERS minus DRS / scalpel). But maybe there are other extractions out there that take advantage of the five clue types?</p> 
    <p>We ended up having quite a bit of discussion on what constitutes a &ldquo;pun&rdquo;. Should the clue be interpretable in two ways, or should the answer be interpretable in two ways? I think we ultimately steered away from the &ldquo;standard crossword&rdquo; pun (clues that end in a question mark) because these can be near-impossible to solve in isolation. I would love to see more pun clues in the future since they give me a good laugh.</p>
    <p>I tried a bit to make both the rows and columns of the 5&times;5 grid read as new cluephrases, but this was just too constrained.</p>
