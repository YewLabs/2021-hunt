<p>This puzzle consists of a chain of people in &perp;IW who want to pass on a message to one another. Each one tells us where to find the next person. Additionally, some number of seconds after talking to one of them, we hear a notification sound from a messaging app.</p>

<p>Ordering by the cycle of who is pointing to whom, and indexing the delay into the name of the messaging app, we get <span class="answer">SOUNDLINK</span>, the answer to the puzzle.
