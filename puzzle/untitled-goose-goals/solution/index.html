<p>There is a student in Lobby 10 with a goose hat whom we can talk to. If we talk to them we then receive a goose hat of our own. A todo list is now also available to us
and can be viewed by hovering our mouse over it. The contents of the todo list are as below.</p>

<ul>
<li>press x HONKo HONKonk</li>
<li>wHONKite "Honk! Honk!" on a whHONKteboard</li>

<li>honk HONKHONKHONKHONKHONKHONK HONKHONK HONKHONKHONKHONKHONK</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to complete the field goal, we must complete these various tasks. The state of the task completion is shared among our entire team. Various letters in the first five tasks are replaced with the
word HONK. These replaced letters go in the final task to spell out "honk THRICE AT PIANO". Below are the tasks with the letters replaced and a description of how to complete them.</p>
