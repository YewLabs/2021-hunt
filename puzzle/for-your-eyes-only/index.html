<p>This interaction is no longer being run. You can complete a modified version of this interaction at your own pace by following the instructions below:</p>

<h3>Interaction Setup Guide</h3>

<p>In the link at the bottom of this page, there is a Google Slides presentation that was used during the interaction for this puzzle. </p>

<p>To simulate the solving experience, follow the following protocol:</p>

<ol>
<li>Whenever you are ready to "enter the room", open the link below and start the presentation. From this time onward, do not write anything down or do anything else (related to this puzzle) on your computer except navigate back and forth between slides. (In the actual interaction slideshow was autoplayed at 1 slide per minute; for an additional challenge, feel free to set up the slideshow the same way). </li>

<li>When you are ready to "leave the room", close the presentation. (For added difficulty, wait one minute before writing anything down -- this vaguely represents the time it took solvers to check out with the interaction runners). </li> 

<li>Wait at least 30 minutes from when you closed the presentation before returning to the presentation. In the meantime, feel free to look whatever you want up, write whatever you want down, etc. When you are ready to return to the presentation, return to step 1. </li>
</ol>

<p>The top-secret presentation is located at <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14mIcG-feGrsNT7-hLuiQ99PLhyhKxhwcMgoDHd4pBYw/edit#slide=id.g8964571c01_0_25">this link</a>. Good luck!</p>
