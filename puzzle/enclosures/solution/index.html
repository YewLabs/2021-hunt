<p>
    In this puzzle, we are presented with a series of diagrams with a lot of subdiagrams, with some regions highlighted
    in various colors.
</p>

<p>
    The first thing we have to realize is that these are all depictions of various calendar systems. We might
    hypothesize
    this based on one of the calendars, like the Egyptian calendar, that divides a year into months into weeks into
    days, or by the number of 12s around, or by doing some careful counting and noticing a 365. Once we have this as a
    hypothesis, we can find confirmation by searching for some of the odder numbers of things, such as 361, in
    conjunction with the word &ldquo;calendar&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>Once we've identified one or more of the calendar systems, we can start to determine what the different colors mean,
    which will help us identify more calendar systems. </p>

    <p>This idea initially came up when I was thinking about what a puzzle entitled &ldquo;Rectangles&rdquo; would look
        like, to complement the puzzles <a href="/puzzle/circles">Circles</a> and <a href="/puzzle/triangles">Triangles</a>. However, my plans were foiled when the most
        thematic answer available came with a title constraint. We opted not to name the puzzle Equiangular
