    The puzzle consists of eight clues and sets of letter blanks. Each clue
    hints a phrase to be filled into the blanks that is a <i><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WordAvalanches/">word
    avalanche</a></i>, in which words form the exact same syllables repeated
    twice, though not necessarily with the same word boundaries and stress.
</p>
<p>
    Some of the letter blanks for each phrase are numbered, and after filling
    in the letters, reading the numbered blanks in order from 1-N gives a
    word for extraction.
