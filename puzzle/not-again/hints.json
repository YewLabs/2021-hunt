[[0.0, [""], "Each line in this puzzle is a clue for a somewhat nonsensical phrase that can be filled into the blanks, one letter per blank. The puzzle title is something you might think to yourself while reading the answer to any of the clues."], [10.0, [""], "The phrase that answers each clue is constrained by having certain phonetic property (having to do with the sounds of the words and syllables rather than their letters or spelling). This property is peculiar and noticable if you read any of the phrases out loud."], [20.0, ["start", " heavy"], "Each of these phrases is a \"word avalanche\" - the same sequence of sounds repeated (exactly twice, in this case). For example, the second clue resolves to \"'Superb, a vortex in soup,' -- herbivore Texan\""], [100.0, ["extract"], "Fill in the blanks for each clue and extract a word from each one by taking the letters with consecutive numbers 1, 2, 3, etc., then read the extracted words to form one more puzzle of the same type, which fits the enumeration at the bottom of the puzzle."]]
