<p>This event took place Saturday evening 8-9pm EST.
Teams were told to send 2-3 members who enjoy social games.</p>

<p>Event participants play a variant of a game called 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo_(game)#Rules">Taboo</a>.
The basic gist of this game is two teams face off with each other
to see which team can guess the most words. A clue-giver must communicate
what their word is to the rest of their team without saying any of the
"taboo" words. If they accidentally say a taboo word, someone on the
opposite team can hit a "buzzer" to penalize the cluer and move on to
the next word. The twist here is that the clue-giver, in addition to
not being able to say any of the "taboo" words on the card, also cannot
say words with more than one syllable.</p>

<p>There is a total of fifty cards between both teams. After the event ends,
participants are given the fifty clue words formatted into a table and are asked to
deduce the answer to the event.</p>

<p>The realization here is that each row corresponds to a two-word phrase
where both words start with the same letter. So we can take the table
above and generate a new table:</p>

<p> When we take the common first letter of these
two-word phrases in order, we get the phrase
TARGET IS DYNAMIC SECOND HALF. We have to take the second
half of a two-word phrase with DYNAMIC where both words
start with D, which means the answer is
<span class="answer">DUO</span>.

    This event heavily used an open-source Taboo repo
    online made and maintained by Lisa Vinson. We are
    extremely grateful for the well-written app and
    even some of the real-time support Lisa gave us
    when setting up this event. The
    GitHub repo can be found
