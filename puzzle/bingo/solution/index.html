<p>Upon opening the page we are provided with a bingo board with a table of statements, in the style of Alex Irpan‚Äôs <a href="https://www.alexirpan.com/mystery-hunt-bingo/" target="_blank">mystery-hunt-bingo</a> generator. Above the given board is a number in the range 1&ndash;25.</p>

<p>Refreshing the page changes both the board and number, but as we refresh, we‚Äôll notice that the statements for a board with a given number do not change (i.e., board #5 will always contain the same statements in the same order), and that some statements are repeated across multiple boards.</p>

<p>Eventually we must realize that all of the statements can be answered as unambiguously true or false when applied to the current Mystery Hunt. Some of the statements reference our own team‚Äôs progress, but these can be answered definitively as well (we generated these statements dynamically when teams first loaded the puzzle based on their unique puzzle progress).</p>

<p>As clued by one of the statements, if we fill in the true statements in the bingo boards and arrange the 25 grids in a 5 x 5 grid (thus making a 25 x 25 grid), we‚Äôll produce a QR code which contains the answer to the puzzle: <span class="answer">IN PROGRESS</span>.</p>

<img src="{{sroot}}qrcode.png" alt="QR code decoding to the answer IN PROGRESS" class="center">

<p>We can use some of the standard features of QR codes (the finder patterns, timing patterns, and even the format info string) to confirm this theory and even disambiguate some statements. The code also has enough error correction built-in to withstand a handful of incorrectly answered statements.</p>

<h2>Authors‚Äô Notes</h2>
<p>JS: When participating in Mystery Hunt, Rahul and I always look forward to <strike>rigging</strike> generating our Bingo board each year, and we thought it would be neat to turn this tradition into a puzzle.</p>

<p>RS: We intentionally set this puzzle as the last regular puzzle to unlock during hunt, hoping that teams would enjoy looking back on all the puzzles they had solved.</p>
