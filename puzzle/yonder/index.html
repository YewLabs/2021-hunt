<li>Start from the east doors of the church, walk forward until you reach the border. Directly in front of you, there should be a light blue car. Record the fifth letter of the large word plastering the side of the car, then get in and head to the Whitehouse.</li>
<li>From your position in the Whitehouse, enter the nearest Photo Sphere and rotate until you reach a green wall. There is a colorful word on the wall; record the last letter, then head toward the river.</li>
<li>You're now across the river from the museum. Record the last letter of the name of the metal creature you can see by the staircase on the other bank. Try not to fall in.</li>
<li>You've fallen into the Elbe! Swim downstream to the next bridge and record the fifth letter of its name and then get out and dry yourself off.</li>
<li>Great, you've ended up on the railroad tracks. Hurry on to the road directly south before you get hit by a train. Note the graffiti of a pharaoh on the train car in front of you and then turn 180 degrees until you're facing the white van. Record the first letter above the windshield of the van. Take the van and drive to Africa.</li>
<li>You ditch the van and start walking due east. Turn right and use the Photo Sphere just outside the supermarch√©. Look up to the black flag and record the last letter of the word preceding the "+". Get back to the van and drive northeast. </li>
<li>Perfect, you've passed the road toll! Now keep following the road towards the tunnel, and before you get there, record the first letter after the hyphen on the green cargo bin on the back of the semi-truck and keep driving.</li>
<li>Ditch the vehicle and walk towards the burger shack to the southeast. Enter the Photo Sphere by the condominiums. Record the first letter of the white word outlined in red and continue on your way.</li>
<li>After a while, you find yourself to the left of the only nearby Photo Sphere and so you enter it. You're in the middle of a residential area with barbed wire topping most property lines. Note a poster attached to the nearest telephone pole. Record the last letter of the first line on that poster and return home. </li>
