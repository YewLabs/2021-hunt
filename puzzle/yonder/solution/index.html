Solvers are presented with nine pictures that are ostensibly screenshots of Google Street View and nine clues that resemble runaround instructions. On each of the pictures, there are a red dot and a blue dot indicating certain locations on the image. The red dot has a line extending from it vertically and the blue dot has a similar horizontal line. Where these lines intersect, there is a purple dot. At this point we can start to see that the photos aren't as seamless as they seem at first glance and that it looks like different locations are stitched together to make up the image. Each location either corresponds to the buildings marked by the red dot or the blue dot and we can identify them using various solve paths to get their coordinates.

From here, the only information we've yet to use from the images are the purple dots. The horizontal and vertical lines inform us that we need the latitude from the blue dot and the longitude from the red dot to reveal a third location that matches the numbered clues with the images ordered alphabetically by extracted city.
