<p>This puzzle is about emoticons, mostly nonstandard ones. One way we might notice to help break in is notice that
    there are exactly twenty-six replies if we include the four that are still typing. Each row corresponds to :X for
    some letter X.</p>

<p>Once we've identified most or all of the emoticons, we can look at what's missing and see AFGN. The word spelled
    using these letters, which has to do with faces, is <span class="answer">FANG</span>.</p>

<h2>Authorsâ€™ Notes</h2>
    We were surprised we were able to find such reasonable descriptions for all of these. After looking at these
    emoticons for a while, though, your mind starts to go a little haywire and you think things are reasonable
    descriptions that definitely aren't.
