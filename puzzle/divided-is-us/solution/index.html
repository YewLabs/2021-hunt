<h2>Figuring out the rules</h2>
<p>For this <em>teamwork time</em> puzzle,
we are presented with a clone of
<a href="https://www.hempuli.com/">Arvi Teikari</a>'s
famous puzzle game
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_Is_You">Baba Is You</a>,
except instead of one player, there are up to four players.
Each player has a separate screen.</p>
<p>After playing with the easy first level,
we figure out the goal is for player 1 (<code>YOU</code>) to reach a <code>WIN</code> object,
and that the rules in one screen affect all other screens.
(It is neither necessary nor sufficient
for other players to reach a <code>WIN</code> object.)
The other rules of the game are fairly similar to the original,
although there are some differences;
most notably, NOUN IS NOUN statements are not valid.
To be specific, the properties that appear in the game
(which are drawn inside colored blocks) are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>YOU</code>: player 1 controls this icon.</li>
<li><code>WIN</code>: the level is won once an icon controlled by player 1 starts a turn on this cell.</li>
<li><code>TWO</code>: player 2 controls this icon.</li>
<li><code>THREE</code>: player 3 controls this icon.</li>
<li><code>FOUR</code>: player 4 controls this icon.</li>
<li><code>PUSH</code>: players can push this block around.</li>
<li><code>STOP</code>: block cannot be moved or moved into.</li>
<li><code>DEFEAT</code>: an icon controlled by a player which moves onto this cell is removed.</li>
<li><code>MELT</code> and <code>HOT</code>: if an icon is <code>MELT</code> and shares a cell
  with a <code>HOT</code> icon, the one labeled <code>MELT</code> is removed.</li>
<li><code>OPEN</code> and <code>SHUT</code>: when an icon with <code>OPEN</code> shares
  a cell with an icon with <code>SHUT</code>, both are removed.
  (Fine print: unlike the original game, all icons on that cell are removed
  if there are more than one.)</li>
<li><code>SINK</code>: if an icon with <code>SINK</code> shares a cell with a different icon, both are removed.</li>
<li><code>WEAK</code>: if an icon with <code>WEAK</code> shares a cell with a different icon, it is removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several nouns, plus two special ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>TEXT</code> refers to all text blocks</li>
<li><code>EMPTY</code> refers to any cell without a block.</li>
</ul>
<p>Detailed solutions to the game itself are deferred to the
<a href="#appendix">appendix</a>.</p>
<h2>Extraction</h2>
<p>Initially, it looks like all the players are playing essentially separate regions.
However, over the course of the levels,
it is gradually revealed that in fact,
the players are actually seeing portions of the <em>same</em> world,
with the four quadrants in reading order,
and in fact players can even move into each others' screens
if <code>WALL IS STOP</code> is not active.</p>
<p>Throughout the game, we might also notice that there are some
unusually placed flags which are either unnecessary or unusable for the level;
the same is true for several dots starting at level 4.
In fact, when we put together the world,
we see that they give <em>semaphore</em> and <em>braille</em> letters.</p>
<p>This gives us the table below (click an image to enlarge it).</p>
<table style="text-align:center;">

<p>When we complete the eighth level,
we get a ninth meta-level which has no game content,
but is instead meant for extraction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Player 1 just sees a flag,
  so the first word of the answer is <code>SECOND</code>,
  spelled by the earlier semaphore letters.</li>
<li>Player 2 just sees a dot,
  so the second word of the answer is <code>GRAND</code>,
  spelled by the earlier Braille letters.</li>
<li>Player 3 sees a sequence of icons.</li>
<li>Player 4 sees the word END, which is not used
  (it indicates there is no more puzzle content).</li>
</ul>
<p><center>
<a href="{{sroot}}level9.png"><img src="{{sroot}}level9.png" alt="Level 9 layout" width="400" /></a>
</center></p>
<p>We only need to find the last word.
Each of the icons on player 3's screen
is an icon that appeared exactly once in an earlier level,
and was assigned to a player.
Since each of the items is four letters long,
we index by the player number to get the following table
(or alternatively, <a href="https://nutrimatic.org/?q=%5Bleaf%5D%5Bbolt%5D%5Blove%5D%5Bfish%5D%5Blamp%5D%5Bmoon%5D%5Bcrab%5D%5Bcake%5D&amp;go=Go]">just use Nutrimatic</a>).</p>

<p>Hence the third word is ALLIANCE.
Combining the three words gives the answer <span class="answer">SECOND GRAND ALLIANCE</span>.</p><h2>Appendix: Solving the levels</h2>

<h2>Authors’ Notes</h2>
<p>This was the very last puzzle to be written for the 2021 MIT Mystery Hunt.
At a meeting in late December,
the editors announced there was exactly one answer remaining,
and it was a teamwork time puzzle.
As it happens, I was thinking earlier that day how we didn't
have our obligatory <em>Baba</em> puzzle yet,
and the idea for the puzzle was born.</p>
<p>Ironically, during test-solving, we commented that
even the standard single-player <em>Baba Is You</em> game
would probably make a good teamwork time puzzle,
because it's so easy to "miss" an idea that is needed to solve a level,
and hence having other people watching is really valuable.
(Not to mention the game is just plain hard.)</p>
<p>We made the decision to hide the undo button until level 1 was cleared
and the small screens until level 5 was cleared,
to maximize the effect of the "a-ha" when players realize
that they are actually looking at the same world.</p>
