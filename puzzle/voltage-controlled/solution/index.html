<p>
    The puzzle contains 11 screenshots of software modular synthesizer
    patches, a number of &ldquo;snippets&rdquo; of letters and numbers in
    sorted order, and a few blanks at the bottom.
</p>
<p>
    We can determine the screenshots are all of <a href="https://vcvrack.com/">VCV
    Rack</a>, a free and open source Eurorack
    modular synthesizer simulator, by googling the names of a few of the modules.
</p>
<p>
    The first step is to reproduce all of the synth patches by downloading
    VCV Rack ourselves, finding the same modules, connecting them with patch
    cables, and setting the knobs in the same way as seen in the images. Some
    modules used in the patches were created by third-party developers, so we
    must find those in the <a href="https://library.vcvrack.com/">VCV Rack
    Library</a> and add them to our account. All of the patches use the
    MIDI-CV module set to &ldquo;QWERTY keyboard&rdquo;, which lets us play
    the synthesizer by tapping keys on a computer QWERTY keyboard.
</p>
<p>
    The mapping of QWERTY keyboard key to musical pitch can be seen in the following image, found in the <a href=https://vcvrack.com/manual/Core#midi-interfaces">VCV Rack manual</a>:
</p>
<img src="{{sroot}}qwerty.png" style="max-width: 500px"/>
<p>
    We infer that the letters, numbers, and punctuation (square brackets)
    that appear on the snippets at the bottom of the puzzle are notes meant
    to be played as keyboard input through one of the synth patches. The
    ripped edges on the snippets suggest we should first piece them together
    like a jigsaw to produce recognizable musical melodies. Eleven of the
    snippets have beveled, rather than ripped, left edges (which matches the
    number of Rack patch screenshots), so we can guess that these are the
    &ldquo;starting points&rdquo;. Eleven other snippets have red outlines,
    so we might also guess at this point that one of these will appear in
    each line and be used somehow for extraction.
</p>
<p>
    The snippets are short enough that piecing together the melodies from the
    given letters/musical notes alone is quite difficult. Fortunately, we can
    use the VCV Rack patches to help, since each one of them reproduces an
    iconic synthesizer sound from a well-known song &mdash; if we can
    recognize the timbre, or use it as a clue to jog our memory, it&rsquo;s
    easier to piece together that tune out of the snippets.
</p>
<p>
    After reassembling all the melodies, matching them with the
    corresponding synth patches, then playing the notes on our computer, we
    can identify the following 11 songs:

    The blanks at the bottom have enumeration 3 2 6. The indexed letters,
    when filled into those blanks, spell out <strong>USE MH PLUGIN</strong>.
    If we return to the VCV Rack Library and search for &ldquo;MH&rdquo;, we
    can find <a href="https://library.vcvrack.com/MH">a plugin by a suspicious
    author</a> containing <a href="https://library.vcvrack.com/MH/Spiro">a
    single module</a>, with a panel design that looks similar to the snippets
    in this puzzle. We can download this plugin and add the Spiro module to
    our existing patches.
</p>
<p>
    The V/OCT and GATE inputs on the Spiro module suggest we should connect
    them to the control voltage outputs (containing the keyboard note pitch,
    and whether a key is being held or not, respectively) of the same names
    on the MIDI-CV module. The Spiro module has two outputs, X and Y, which
    suggest that we should plot the signals being emitted from the module as
    a 2D path in the XY plane. Rack has a built-in oscilloscope module (VCV
    Scope) that has a XY display mode feature if we hit the button labeled
    X&times;Y, so we can add a Scope to the patch also and connect it up.
</p>
<p>
    At first, playing notes to Spiro just seems to result in spirograph
    patterns that don&rsquo;t seem to convey any information.
</p>
<img src="{{sroot}}spiro.jpg" style="max-width: 500px">
<p>
    But if we play a sequence of notes that matches the snippets for one of
    the songs we identified earlier, Spiro will instead draw out a letter or
    two letters on the oscilloscope. For example, playing the sequence
    E63Y6E63Y6 (for Just Dance) results in:
</p>
<img src="{{sroot}}spiroE.jpg" style="max-width: 500px">
<p>
    We can do this for each sequence of snippets to get new letters for each song:

<div class="author-note">
<h2>Author’s Notes</h2>
<p>
This puzzle was inspired by how synthesizers often come with presets that
reproduce sounds from well-known songs. One of my first experiences with this
was playing with a preset for the VST wavetable synth <a
href="https://xferrecords.com/products/serum">Xfer Serum</a> that emulated
the oscillator hard sync lead from <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdeYwObD-j4">Daft Punk&rsquo;s Robot
Rock</a>, and I remember being amazed at how close it sounded to the original
patch even though the synth itself was different.
</p>
<p>
Some synth sounds are iconic and recognizable no matter what context
they&rsquo;re used in. You might not know it by name but I guarantee
you&rsquo;ve heard the sound of the E.PIANO 1 preset on the Yamaha DX7 in
dozens of songs.
So the idea here with this puzzle was, instead of a typical music
identification puzzle in which you are given a bunch of audio clips, what if
we just give you a bunch of synth patches that produce iconic sounds and you
supply your own notes to make the audio clips yourself? My hope was that
it&rsquo;d introduce some interesting new puzzly ambiguities (&ldquo;which
notes belong with which synth sound?&rdquo;), make the music ID less
shortcuttable (you probably wouldn&rsquo;t be able to Shazam your own synth
performance), and along the way hopefully give you some joy plunking out your
own funny beep boop noises (the real reason any of us care about synthesizers
in the first place).
</p>
<p>
The final step of this puzzle was inspired by <a href="http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2011/puzzles/katamari_damacy/electronic_love/">Electronic Love</a> from the 2011 Mystery Hunt.
