<p>
Solvers are presented with a list of "tasting reviews" of unspecified objects, each associated with a location (a country or US state) and a rating (some number of stars). On the surface, these reviews may appear to be about coffee (or other beverages) but solvers might notice that the ingredients appearing in each reviewâ€™s notes sound like ingredients you might expect to find in cookies.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, each review is actually a loose description of a <a href="https://www.pepperidgefarm.com/product-categories/cookies/">Pepperidge Farm cookie</a> &mdash; specifically, a Pepperidge Farm cookie named after a city in the corresponding location (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milano_(cookie)">Milano</a> for Italy) <a href="#footnote1">[1]</a>. Prominent ingredients (e.g. macadamia nuts) for each cookie appear as "notes" in its review (with the exception that milk chocolate appears just as "milk", and dark chocolate appears as having a "dark roast"). Other adjectives in the comments loosely describe the texture and shape of the cookie.
</p>

<p>
Using the locations and comments, it is possible to match up Pepperidge Farm cookies and reviews as follows:
</p>

<div>
<table>
<tr><td><b>Location</b></td><td><b>Pepperidge Farm Cookie</b></td><td><b>Rating (# of stars)</b></td><tr>
<tr><td>Italy</td><td>Naples</td><td>6</td><td>S</td></tr>
<tr><td>Switzerland</td><td>Zurich</td><td>2</td><td>U</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ireland</td><td>Dublin</td><td>3</td><td>B</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hawaii</td><td>Maui</td><td>1</td><td>M</td></tr>
<tr><td>Florida</td><td>Sanibel</td><td>4</td><td>I</td></tr>
<tr><td>Florida</td><td>Captiva</td><td>4</td><td>T</td></tr>
<tr><td>Massachusetts</td><td>Nantucket</td><td>4</td><td>T</td></tr>
<tr><td>Michigan</td><td>Mackinac</td><td>2</td><td>A</td></tr>
<tr><td>Belgium</td><td>Brussels</td><td>5</td><td>S</td></tr>
<tr><td>New York</td><td>Montauk</td><td>4</td><td>T</td></tr>

<tr><td>Italy</td><td>Milano</td><td>5</td><td>N</td></tr>
<tr><td>France</td><td>Bordeaux</td><td>5</td><td>E</td></tr>
<tr><td>Virginia</td><td>Chesapeake</td><td>4</td><td>S</td></tr>

<p>Indexing the number of stars in each rating into the cookie names leads to the phrase SUBMIT TASTINESS. The answer to this puzzle is <span class="answer">TASTINESS</span>. </p>

<p id="footnote1">[1] This is also confirmed by the flavortext, which sounds like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXUxLqqmhNs">an old Pepperidge Farm advertising tagline</a>.</p>
<p id="footnote2">[2] The Lexington cookies are <a href="https://patch.com/massachusetts/lexington/lexington-a-destination-and-a-dessert">probably</a> named after Lexington, MA (instead of Lexington, KY, or another US-based Lexington), although Pepperidge Farms has never officially confirmed this. </p>
