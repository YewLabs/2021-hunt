  Solvers are presented with several paragraphs describing lab directions,
  except the reagents and products are all crossword-style definitions embedded
  into the sentences, and labelled A-V. At the bottom is a large chemical
  reaction that uses the letters A-V as well as a mystery ingredient:
  <span class="red">A PERFECT MATCH!</span>
</p>

<p>The first step is to identify the words or phrases labelled A-V.</p>

<div class="reactions">
  <p>
    Let us start with something simple. Add the
    <b>place where spokes meet (HUB, A)</b> to a
    <b>piece of granola (OAT, B)</b>, then heat the mixture to get a
    <b>cape-wearing figure (HERO, C)</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Empty the container, and while it is still hot, pour the tasty and sour
    <b>neurally-advanced mollusks (CEPHALOPODS, D)</b> into it to get a
    <b>note exchangeable for currency in London (CHEQUE, E)</b>, after fuming
    out the
    <b
      >cable whose conductive components are separated by a dielectric (COAX,
      F)</b
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    Still keeping the heat on, allow a solid
    <b
      >having the cadence of hypochondriac, apothecary, or serendipity
      (PENTASYLLABIC, G)</b
    >
    to interact with an
    <b>observer of ESP and apparitional sightings (PARAPSYCHOLOGIST, H)</b>, and
    wait until their interactions
    <b>convert sunlight into ATP (PHOTOSYNTHESIZE, I)</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Transport an
    <b>aural navigation system (SONAR, J)</b>
    to high altitudes, where it is exposed to the wet and slippery
    <b> author known for a kyphotic protagonist (HUGO, K)</b> to become a liquid
    which should not be drunk, <b>no matter the means (HOWSOEVER, L)</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Blow a <b>magical curse (HEX, M)</b> onto a
    <b> Brazilian meat dish featuring beans (FEIJOADA, N)</b> to get
    <b>someone who might spread frightening news (FEARMONGER, O)</b>, who will
    be surrounded by a
    <b>circle associated with Powers and Dominions (HALO, P)</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mix a
    <b>symbol resembling 3 but with a curved-back tail in Tokyo (RU, Q)</b> with
    an
    <b>antiquated communication method (FAX, R)</b>
    - carefully handling the latter so that it does not touch anything else by
    accident - to find a
    <b>
      Federalist who lost the presidential race to James Monroe (RUFUS KING,
      S)</b
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lastly, add the <b>MIT term subsuming the Mystery Hunt (IAP, T)</b> to the
    <b>exclamation of sailors approaching terra firma (HO, U)</b> to obtain a
    yellowish substance that
    <b>raises a weighted load using a pulley system (HOISTS, V)</b>.
  </p>

  The paragraphs also contain pieces of information that are not relevant to the
  crossword-style definitions, and instead describe the chemical properties of
  reagents or products. For example, COAX can be "fumed out" so it should be a
  gas, HUGO is "wet and slippery" so it should be a liquid, and FAX is a
  substance that should not touch other things. From here, the crucial
  realization is that the words can be transformed into chemical compounds by
  replacing N letters by the number N; this procedure is common in, for example,
  writing "internationalization" and "accessibility" as "i18n" and "a11y", respectively.
  The word reaction described in each
  paragraph thus becomes a valid chemical reaction, albeit without specified
  coefficients. The full list of reactions is as follows:

  The last step is to plug every compound into the large reaction. To balance
  it, we need <span class="red">A PERFECT MATCH!</span> to cancel out the extra
  elements on the left-hand side, which are: 2P, 2S, H, O, Ho, Ru. The unique
  "word compound", i.e., anagram, that can be formed with these elements is
  PHoSPHORuS (or PHOSPHoRuS). The element <span class="answer">PHOSPHORUS</span> is
  both the key ingredient in making matches and the answer to this puzzle.

<h2>Authorâ€™s Notes</h2>

<p>This puzzle started with the idea of contracting letters into numbers, but at first I thought the theme would be around board games rather than chemistry. We made the thematic switch to chemistry to avoid colliding with other puzzles in the hunt, and once I saw that FEIJOADA could be abbreviated as Fe2O3 (ferric oxide) I knew it was meant to be. Earlier versions had HOLO (from Spice and Wolf) instead of HUGO, PERCUSSIONISTS instead of PENTASYLLABIC, and FELLMONGER instead of FEARMONGER, but these were replaced to reduce potential for confusion. Many thanks to Jon Schneider and Anderson Wang for helping me refine the execution of this puzzle!</p>
