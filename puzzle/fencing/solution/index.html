<p>This event took place on Saturday 4-6pm EST. Teams were told to
send 1-4 members who liked crosswords. Once the event started,
teams were directed to a website where they could play crossword
games with other hunt participants.</p>

<p>Teams have to solve a significant amount of a crossword in order
to get the answer. Once they solve a large portion
of the grid, they can see the following along the top-left /
bottom-right diagonal: "NOW CALL IN FACIAL", so teams call in
<span class="answer">FACIAL</span> as the answer.
