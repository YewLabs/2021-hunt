    Additionally we are given an image of Baker House's famous piano drop, along with a 7&times;6 grid superimposed over the windows of Baker House. Our answers are too long to fit the rows of the grid, but combined with the piano theme of the meta, we might notice that every answer contains a different solf&egrave;ge syllable, which can be compressed into a single box. Note that the 5th syllable is SOL and not SO which compresses the 8 letter answer into 6 boxes.

    A natural ordering is to use the scale starting from DO and ending at TI. We can do this as follows, which also places the square where the piano lies on the DO:
</p>
<center>
<table id="grid">
    <tbody>
        <tr><td>U</td><td>N</td><td class="solfege">DO</td><td>I</td><td>N</td><td>G</td></tr>
        <tr><td>E</td><td>R</td><td class="solfegedrop">A</td><td>S</td><td>U</td><td class="solfege">RE</td></tr>
        <tr><td>H</td><td>A</td><td class="solfege">MI</td><td>T</td><td>U</td><td class="solfegedrop">P</td></tr>
        <tr><td>G</td><td>O</td><td class="solfegedrop">O</td><td>D</td><td class="solfege">FA</td><td>T</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="solfege">SOL</td><td>V</td><td>A</td><td>B</td><td class="solfegedrop">L</td><td>E</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="solfegedrop">L</td><td>U</td><td>L</td><td class="solfege">LA</td><td>B</td><td>Y</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="solfege">TI</td><td>N</td><td>F</td><td class="solfegedrop">O</td><td>I</td><td>L</td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
</center>
<p>
    The arrow on the picture pointing downward from the piano evokes the piano drop, but it also suggests the way to extract the answer. The arrow directly points at the square below the piano, and if we take each solf&egrave;ge syllable and read the letter under it we spell out the answer <span class="answer">APOLLO</span>. (TI, being the note on the bottom row, doesn't give us a letter.)
