<p>The Double Jeopardy! clues are much stranger, and they don’t even seem to be trivia questions. Noting that Jeopardy is a game show where players are ostensibly given answers and must provide questions, we can realize that each of the clues here is the answer to a famous title question, but interpreted literally (e.g. “The player that just hit a single” is the answer to “Who’s on first?”). These are:</p>

<table id="grid">
    <tr><td>We don't know yet, but we can observe him in exactly one day and find out = <span class="clueans">WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE MAN OF TOMORROW?</span></td><td>The person who's speaking next, I guess = <span class="clueans">WHOSE LINE IS IT ANYWAY?</span></td><td>Probably in the parking lot, bro = <span class="clueans">DUDE, WHERE’S MY CAR?</span></td><td>I don't know, but based on the name I'd start searching in California = <span class="clueans">WHERE IN THE WORLD IS CARMEN SANDIEGO?</span></td><td>The player that just hit a single = <span class="clueans">WHO’S ON FIRST?</span></td><td>A strong emotional feeling = <span class="clueans">WHAT IS LOVE?</span></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Thou wilt find me at the family reunion = <span class="clueans">O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?</span></td><td>The person in charge = <span class="clueans">WHO’S THE BOSS?</span></td><td>Maybe, if you're truly sorry = <span class="clueans">CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME?</span></td><td>I certainly hope so, given that I graduated! = <span class="clueans">ARE YOU SMARTER THAN A 5TH GRADER?</span></td><td>Whatever amount he requires to live on = <span class="clueans">HOW MUCH LAND DOES A MAN NEED?</span></td><td>Yes, I'd say I have a lot of practice = <span class="clueans">ARE YOU EXPERIENCED?</span></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Yes, the karaoke party is very audible = <span class="clueans">DO YOU HEAR THE PEOPLE SING?</span></td><td>My diagnosis is...the sky = <span class="clueans">WHAT’S UP, DOC?</span></td><td>Inside your cranium = <span class="clueans">WHERE IS MY MIND?</span></td><td>It depends on whether their circuits can generate the necessary ovine imagery = <span class="clueans">DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP?</span></td><td>Not sure, but they must have the keys to the kennel = <span class="clueans">WHO LET THE DOGS OUT?</span></td><td>Some cash and my driver's license = <span class="clueans">WHAT’S IN YOUR WALLET?</span></td></tr>
    <tr><td>At the very least, people traumatized by modern English literature = <span class="clueans">WHO’S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?</span></td><td>No, I'm not very superstitious in general = <span class="clueans">DO YOU BELIEVE IN MAGIC?</span></td><td>Your turophile roommate who can't keep their hands to themselves = <span class="clueans">WHO MOVED MY CHEESE?</span></td><td>You can find out by checking who has crumbs on their fingers = <span class="clueans">WHO STOLE THE COOKIE FROM THE COOKIE JAR?</span></td><td>Yes, I'll get the carrot and tree branches! = <span class="clueans">DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN?</span></td><td>Inside the patty = <span class="clueans">WHERE’S THE BEEF?</span></td></tr>
    <tr><td>It depends on how worthwhile you think your presence is = <span class="clueans">SHOULD I STAY OR SHOULD I GO?</span></td><td>You all stay in bed until you wake up = <span class="clueans">WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?</span></td><td>The other people on patrol, possibly = <span class="clueans">WHO WATCHES THE WATCHMEN?</span></td><td>Probably, most people are aware of Santa Claus = <span class="clueans">DO THEY KNOW IT’S CHRISTMAS?</span></td><td>Because that pirate drank it = <span class="clueans">WHY IS THE RUM GONE?</span></td><td>Yeah, I bought a carton yesterday = <span class="clueans">GOT MILK?</span></td></tr>
</table>

<p>Note that the answers are always from the point of view of a hypothetical person being asked the question, so e.g. if the question uses the word “I” or “my”, the response will use “you” or “your” and vice versa.</p>

<p>The last step is to notice that each of the questions is the title of something that uniquely matches with one of the descriptors in the first board, i.e. the “This X” phrase before the colon. For example, “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?” matches with “This sci-fi book”. This lets us reorder the answers in single Jeopardy to match with the double Jeopardy board (note that the single Jeopardy categories are alphabetized, and the clues are subjectively sorted by difficulty, while the double Jeopardy clues don’t have any discernible ordering).</p>

<p>Reading the first letters (or character, in the case of 300) of the single Jeopardy answers in this order gives “3 WORDS JEOPARDY KEPLER JOKE ANSWER”. This is a reference to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-OdYT3uO-w">2017 College Championship finals</a>, where contestant Lilly Chin answered “Who is the spiciest memelord?” to a Final Jeopardy question on Johannes Kepler. The answer to this puzzle is <span class="answer">THE SPICIEST MEMELORD</span>.</p>

<div class="author-note">
<h2>Author’s Notes</h2>
    <p>This puzzle was originally inspired by thinking about <span class="work-title">Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</span> and how it could be funny to answer the title literally, and theming it around <span class="work-title">Jeopardy!</span> was a natural choice after that. This idea had actually been sitting in my puzzle ideas doc for a while and I’d totally forgotten about it, but after realizing that we had a very appropriate answer I knew it had to be done.</p>

    <p>I brainstormed a lot of potential extraction ideas, including various things with sorting the titles by question word (what/where/who/etc.) or by category (music/film/etc.), but eventually settled on this as giving the most flexibility, even though it’s pretty standard. The idea to run single Jeopardy as an interaction only came later on, when trying to think of ways to address the problem of “directly googling a bunch of trivia questions isn’t that fun/interesting”.</p>
