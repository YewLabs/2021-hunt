<p>The hidden constraint on the answers to the given clues is that they need to contain three consecutive alphabetical letters. This is hinted at by the title, which is meant to suggest the phrase "three in a row". We may also notice the suspicious trigrams in some of the more constrained answers.</p>

<p>The answers to the clues are:</p>

<p>Next, we notice that the first letters of the clues give the instruction TAKE LETTER AFTER. Extracting the letter after each consecutive triple gives the cluephrase PHONE THREE PLUS Y. The three consecutive letters on the 3 key of a phone are DEF, which combined with Y gives us the final answer of <span class="answer">DEFY</span>.</p>
