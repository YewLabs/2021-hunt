<p>Despite its appearance, this puzzle is not a runaround on MIT campus.</p>

<p>The first thing we have to realize, either by reading these descriptions and thinking that the descriptions of
    &ldquo;hallways&rdquo; don't seem like MIT corridors, or by looking at &ldquo;colorful&rdquo; in the text of the
    puzzle, or by looking at different interpretations until the data makes sense, is that this puzzle is about subway
    trains. We start at Kendall/MIT and follow the instructions, interpreting things seen around MIT as similar things
    seen around the real world.</p>

<p>On the fifth instruction, we reach a hiccup; we don't know how to continue beyond the end of the Green Line; even the
    puzzle acknowledges that it seems impossible. However, if we've been careful so far, we've now extracted the letters
    XKCD. Searching for &ldquo;xkcd subways&rdquo; yields <a href="https://xkcd.com/1196/">a relevant xkcd comic</a>
    that will help us solve the rest of the puzzle. In this map, the Green Line continues on to Montreal rather than
    ending at Lechmere. With this insight, we can solve the rest of the clues:</p>

<p>Once we've completed our colorful journey through all 18 metro systems in North America (or the 18 that the xkcd
    comic knows about, anyway), we turn to extract an answer. Sadly, BCDEECBABDCFGABDCACAEDBFBAA is not a particularly
    good cluephrase. However, the colored blanks at the bottom help us find an insight &mdash; we need to extract from
    each color of line separately.</p>
<p>Each color extracts a contiguous set of letters starting with A; for example, blue extracts A through G. This
    suggests that we draw lines on the xkcd comic between the stations we visited of each color, in alphabet order.</p>
