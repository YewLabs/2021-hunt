<p>This is a crossword puzzle in which some letters, instead of being added to the word so far like normal, are subtracted in one direction. For example, AILS is spelled C A (-C) I L S.</p>

<p>This puzzle went through many, many iterations before we settled on this version. The initial idea was a puzzle all of whose squares were either "minus" (in both directions) or "plus" (i.e. 2-letter rebuses). However, we ended up cutting it down to this when that was too hard to construct.</p></div>
