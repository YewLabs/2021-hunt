<p>On the first floor of &perp;IW.kilo there is a computer in the southwest corner whose screen is turned on. If we use that computer we'll be transported to a room in &perp;IW.kilo that has a giant <a href="https://www.staples.com/Staples-Easy-Button/product_606396">Staples Easy</a> button guarded by some size gates.</p>

<p>The room layout is shown below with the size change devices details marked. Note that the Easy button requires a teammate of size XL to step on it.</p>

<p>When we enter this room we are automatically set to size M. In order to have a teammate of size XL reach the Easy button we need a total of 4 teammates to perform the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>One teammate of size M holds the M door open. Three teammates use the size change device behind the M door to become size XL.</li>
<li>One teammate of size XL holds the XL door open. Two teammates use the size change device behind the XL door to become size L.</li>
<li>One teammate of size L holds the L door open. One teammate uses the size change device behind the L door to become size S.</li>
<li>The teammate of size XL holds the XL door open. The teammate of size S goes through the XL door and holds the S door open. The teammate of size XL goes through the S door and presses the Easy button.</li>
</ul>

<p>When the Easy button is pressed, it makes the classic "That was easy." sound effect and we complete the field goal, obtaining the answer <span class="answer">THINKING OF</span>.</p>
