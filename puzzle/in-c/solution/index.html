<p>This puzzle is a listing of 53 lines of C code, very vaguely ordered by length. Some of the lines are identical; others are clearly not valid C. We may suspect that our goal is to construct a valid program that follows the rules in the opening comment, and then see what it does when run.</p>

<p>Our first clue is the title and copyright year. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_C"><i>In C</i></a> is a piece of music composed in 1964 that consists of 53 melodic fragments, to be repeated any number of times or skipped at the discretion of each performer, but remaining in order. Each fragment thus corresponds to one line of the program; identical fragments give identical lines. The correspondence is based on the pitch of each note:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>A</td><td>hexadecimal number</td>
<tr><td>B♭</td><td>control flow keyword</td>
<tr><td>B</td><td>function</td>
<tr><td>C</td><td>type or type-related keyword</td>
<tr><td>D</td><td>character literal</td>
<tr><td>E</td><td>variable</td>
<tr><td>F</td><td>decimal number</td>
<tr><td>F♯</td><td><tt>++/&minus;&minus;</tt> (variable increment/decrement)</td>
<tr><td>G</td><td><tt>&/*</tt> (pointer reference/dereference)</td>
<tr><td>rest</td><td>comment</td>
</table>

<p>In other words, the order in which these categories of thing appear in each line of C matches the order of the notes in the corresponding <i>In C</i> fragment. Things not in these categories (for example, parentheses and arithmetic or logical operators) have no musical counterpart; tied notes and consecutive rests count as one thing for matching purposes.</p>

<p>Using the score of <i>In C</i>, we can match everything up and determine the correct ordering of the lines, but this does not form a valid program. We still have to figure out how many times to repeat each line. We can do this by going through step by step and examining what the lines do, using the comments as signposts, and remembering that we have to set all the array entries. The final order and repeat counts are:</p>

</table>

<p>Note: Usually, this might be where you&rsquo;d expect a rigorous derivation or logical solve path. My confession is that I can&rsquo;t give you that. When I say that we need an array entry to be set, that only means that we should generally expect the program to do things that have an effect; given the long cluephrase and constrained code, there isn&rsquo;t much room to perform useless or redundant operations. I haven&rsquo;t demonstrated that there aren&rsquo;t other solutions that also leave the array filled but in a different state, and maybe that makes me a bad puzzle constructor.</p>

<p>The final program is available <a href="{{sroot}}out.c">here</a>. When compiled and run, it leaves a sequence of 22 values in <tt>F</tt>; promisingly, these values are all close to integers, and the first four convincingly spell out LINE in A1Z26. But then there are some negative values &mdash; what&rsquo;s going on? Well, this is a C program, so it isn&rsquo;t just A1Z26; it's actually ASCII minus 64. Using this we can extract the rest of the message:</p>

<p><i>In C</i> fragment 49 note 5 is a B♭, and it corresponds to the keyword <tt>do</tt> in the first line of the final loop. This is supposed to sound like something with five letters (according to the last comment) that means &ldquo;$&rdquo;. If we pronounce &ldquo;do&rdquo; as in C, we won&rsquo;t get anywhere. But if we pronounce it as in &ldquo;doe, a deer&rdquo; (fittingly representing C in fixed-note solfege), then it sounds like slang for money: <span class="answer">DOUGH</span>.</p>

<div class="author-note">
<h2>Author’s Notes</h2>

<p>This was not originally intended to be a C esoterica puzzle. In my mind, the gold standard for this kind of puzzle is <a href="http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2011/puzzles/katamari_damacy/efficiency/">Efficiency</a>, and I knew I wasn&rsquo;t nearly good enough at either logic puzzles or C to match it. However, I did want a puzzle titled &ldquo;In C&rdquo; to exist in the world, and that meant having 53 pieces of something that would have to be repeated 0 or more times in the right order. Maybe that something is the <i>input</i> to a C program, or maybe some other part of the puzzle tells you how many times to repeat each piece, or maybe you actually have a char * and have to perform 53 conundrum-like steps on it that each keep it a valid word. But I kept coming back to the simplest expression of the concept as just 53 fragments of code. In order to make the <i>In C</i> score relevant, there would be some rigid (therefore highly constraining) logical correspondence used for reordering; furthermore, there aren&rsquo;t really that many interesting ways to make solvers repeat a fragment N times. So I ended up having to pull a lot of dirty tricks; to quote this puzzle&rsquo;s editor: &ldquo;o god this code is a bit monstrous&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here is a list of facts about the letter C.</p>

<p>In mathematics, C represents the complex numbers. Complex numbers are related to angles using the e<sup>iθ</sup> = cos(θ) + i sin(θ) relation, which is occasionally abbreviated as cis(θ). &ldquo;cis&rdquo; in turn is occasionally found (Wikipedia says it&rsquo;s European) as an abbreviation for the note C♯ (which does not appear in <i>In C</i>). C♯ is also a programming language. Going back to angles, they are measured in degrees, and another thing measured in degrees is temperature, where C stands for Celsius. F stands for Fahrenheit and is also a note. In programming, C is a hexadecimal digit, as are A through F, and in music, C can stand for 4/4 meter or common time (<i>In C</i> has no defined meter). <i>In C</i> has 53 parts; there are 53 non-exponent bits in a double-precision floating point number. MIDI assigns values from 0 to 127 to pitches, with middle C being 60, which lines up pretty well with ASCII. <i>In C</i> sounds somewhat like ANSI (it also sounds like the last half of Efficiency). A circled C represents copyright, which starts off the program.</p>

<p>Some traces of these remain in the puzzle. Z is a complex variable and the final loop converts Fahrenheit values to Celsius, both of which originally (when the concept was a bit simpler) the solver was supposed to figure out for themselves. Maybe plotting degrees as angles would have drawn out letters on the complex plane? It wasn&rsquo;t really clear.</p>

<p>As long as I&rsquo;m talking about puzzles that I want to exist but am not good enough to write, this seems as good a place as any to make the following offer. If you&rsquo;re looking for an idea for a modern music crossover puzzle that goes as deep into the weeds as this one, you should write one about tone rows except they&rsquo;re linguistic tones. We even have a title for you: &ldquo;The Second Vietnamese School&rdquo;. You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>

<p>Finally: please never write real code that looks like this.</p>
