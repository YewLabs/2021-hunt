<p>This is a puzzle about repeatedly indexing using the same numbers as indices into a variety of material.</p>
<p>The first thing we must do is solve the clues given in the puzzle:</p>

<p>Indexing into the answers, we get <b>CLUES</b>. As the title suggests, we repeat. Indexing the numbers into their corresponding clues (including digits) gives <b>TITLE</b>. Indexing these same numbers into the title of the puzzle, we get <b>FAQA9</b> (we might try to ignore numbers, but that yields the nonsense string TYLOA). The ninth entry in the hunt FAQ is:</p>
<blockquote>        <b>Q</b>: Is this FAQ a puzzle?<br>
        <b>A</b>: It's not an Icelandic crossword about Bjork. It's not a teacup pomeranian owned by the Duchess of York. You could consecrate it on a Friday as a ritual offering to the stork. Quantum physicists have postulated that it can manifest a new flavor of quark. As many times as you try to solve it, you'll probably still look like a dork. But don't come chasing us with a pitchfork. We promise you don't need code of Morse or pens of pork. The Swedish Chef sends Scandinavian salutations... bork bork bork!
</blockquote>
<p>We try indexing into this FAQ question, which is worded in a very contrived way, and we get TCURO. However, we note that this FAQ entry is very long, so instead of indexing by letter we index by word. This yields <b>NEW YORK TIMES FRIDAY CROSSWORD</b>. Indexing into the <a href="https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=1/15/2021">Friday crossword</a> (by taking the letters in the cells marked with those numbers), we get the answer, <span class="answer">FUEGO</span>:</p>

<h2>Authorsâ€™ Notes</h2>
   We wrote this puzzle knowing we would have to rewrite it a few days before Hunt (since we didn't have advance knowledge of the NYT crosswords for the week). It was worth it.
