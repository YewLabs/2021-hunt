    <p>Upon opening this puzzle, we are presented with a table containing a
        number of phrases, placed seemingly at
        random. Some of the clues are bolded, and the dashes on the right match
        the number of bolded clues in each row.
    </p>

    <p>A little research allows us to determine the truth value of each
        clue, or, in at least one case, resolve the clue to the word
        TRUE. Treating the truth values of the bolded clues as binary, we can
        read each row as a letter by indexing the
        resulting binary number into the alphabet.</p>

    <p>Using this information, we can deduce the answer to the puzzle as
        follows.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The answer is playable in a game of English Scrabble. This excludes
            any proper nouns.</li>
        <li>The length of the answer is not divisible by two or three, and the
            answer has fewer letters than the title
            does. The length must be five.</li>
        <li>The first letter of the answer is adjacent to a vowel in the
            alphabet, has exactly one enclosed space when
            written as a capital letter, and is not in the word PUZZLE. The
            first letter must be D.</li>
        <li>The last letter of the answer is one of the eight most frequent
            letters of the English alphabet, has no
            enclosed spaces when written as a capital letter and is not in the
            word TRUE. It, however, is in the title of the puzzle.
            The last letter must be either N or S.</li>
        <li>The fourth, or penultimate, letter of the answer is not normally
            drawn with a single stroke in lowercase, is
            a consonant, and is not in the word BOXLIKE. The fourth letter must
            be one of D, F, P, or T.</li>
        <li>The number of vowels in the answer is even. Because the length is
            five, and three of the letters are
            consonants, there must be two vowels. Specifically, the second and
            third letters are vowels.</li>
        <li>The second letter is a vowel, has no enclosed spaces,
            and has a curved stroke when written as a
            capital letter. The second letter must be U.</li>
        <li>The third letter is a vowel and within the first six letters of the
            English alphabet. The third letter must
            be either A or E, but since the first three letters must form a
            valid English word and DUA isn’t a word, the
            third letter must be E.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This gives us an answer of DUE[DFPT][NS], which must be <span
            class="answer">DUETS</span>, an appropriate answer to
        this puzzle of duality.</p>

    <p>At this point, we can fill in the bottom row. We note that if the bottom
        right corner were a 1, the rightmost column would have three 0s in a
        row, which is not allowed. Therefore, the bottom right corner is a 0.
    </p>

    <p>Similarly, the last 0 in the bottom row must go in the third column. If
        it were in any other column, there would be three 1s in a row in the
        bottom row. </p>
