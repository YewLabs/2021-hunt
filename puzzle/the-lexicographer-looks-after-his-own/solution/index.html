<h2>Authors’ Notes</h2>

<p>We the authors enjoy two things: satirical humor and Persona 5. The Devil's Dictionary by Ambrose Bierce embodies the former, and is referenced in the latter. We wanted to share the begetting ourselves a handsome person's love of this lexicon with the world in the form of a puzzle, and we hope solvers had a whale of a time.</p>
