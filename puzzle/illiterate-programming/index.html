<ul>
<li><code class="monospace">a language foundation maintains this programming language that draws heavy inspiration from c++ but includes optional garbage collection alongside low level features such as inline assembly</code>
<li><code class="monospace">game development scripts often use this lightweight programming language but other applications unrelated to games also often embed or use this programming language to implement extensions</code>
<li><code class="monospace">it's not object oriented but this programming language descended from algol is considered very high level and has powerful facilities for processing strings and textual patterns</code>
<li><code class="monospace">relatively concise procedural code and better handling of nulls without sacrificing compilation speed are some of the features of this programming language that interoperates with java</code>
<li><code class="monospace">some of the most notable features this purely functional programming language has are being lazily evaluated and using monads to isolate side effects among other applications</code>
<li><code class="monospace">this ancient programming language features a highly verbose syntax like english and sees widespread deployments involving governmental financial applications like the united states internal revenue service</code>
<li><code class="monospace">this calculator language that was standardized by posix also lets users define functions and originated as a simple compiler in front of its stack based predecessor</code>
<li><code class="monospace">this functional programming language in the lineage of coq is also an interactive proof assistant and both its name and its logo are references to coq</code>
<li><code class="monospace">this general purpose programming language is designed to do heavy numeric computations particularly well and led to three of its cocreators winning a numerical software prize</code>
<li><code class="monospace">this programming language compiles to bytecode that runs on the erlang virtual machine and is similarly designed towards concurrent distributed applications but has more metaprogramming facilities</code>
<li><code class="monospace">this programming language named after a musical note alongside many others that interoperate under microsoft's .net framework is part of the ml functional programming language family</code>
<li><code class="monospace">this programming language uses interface types and embedding instead of subclassing to achieve polymorphism and though it notably lacks generics there are several public draft designs</code>
