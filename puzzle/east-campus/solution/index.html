<p>We are presented with a binary tree where some nodes have letters. When going up the tree, all the edges to the left
    are brown, and all edges to the right are black.

<p>Reading all the letters from left to right (or, equivalently, doing an <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#In-order_(LNR)">in-order tree traversal</a>) gives the
    message BE
    QUICK DO THIS GO SEE THE WEST PARALLEL CHECK OUT ITS NORTHERNMOST SECTION READ NAME GOOD JOB GO OFF BACK TO ANSWERS.
    MIT's East Campus dormitory consists of two parallels, west and east, and the northernmost section of the west
    parallel
    is called &ldquo;Wood&rdquo; (this can be seen on <a
        href="https://www.google.com/maps/@42.3604941,-71.0887335,20.23z">Google Maps</a> or by going there in person).

<p>The &ldquo;WOOD&rdquo; message, combined with the weird capitalization in the East Campus logo (which spells out
    &ldquo;EAT PUS&rdquo; and
    &ldquo;scam&rdquo;) hints at the main aha: each answer can be unwoven into two words, one of which is an object made
    of wood.
    For example, <tt>
        <bn>B</bn>ITE M<bn>ARK</bn>
    </tt> can be split into <tt>
        <bn>BARK</bn>
    </tt> and <tt>ITEM</tt>.

<p>Now that we have split the answers, we can return to the tree. Going left along the tree where the next letter of the
    word is wooden (along a brown edge), and going right where the next letter is not wooden (along a black edge), we
    find that each answer passes through exactly three letters. The paths and letters are listed below:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Answer</th>
        <th>Wood word</th>
        <th>Other word</th>
        <th>L/R sequence (L=wood, R=non-wood)</th>

        <td>_ _ T _ _ C M</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>(The L=<bn>wood</bn>, R=non-wood correspondence is meant to be clued by the coloring, but it's easily verified &mdash; if R
    and L are switched, most of
    the paths cannot be drawn on the tree.)

<p>When we've done this for enough of the answers, we notice that the letters are all unique and go from A to U, using
    each of those 21 letters once. We can take the letter of the answer corresponding to the A extracted from the tree,
    then the letter corresponding to the B, and so on (for example, A corresponds to the 5th letter in SEA BREAM, which
    is R):

    East Campus needs a <span class="answer">RANDOM LUMBER GENERATOR</span> to keep its fire burning!


<div class="author-note">
<h2>Authorsâ€™ Notes</h2>

    <p> This puzzle went through many many iterations before settling on this version. Early versions used the numbers
        1&ndash;21
        instead of letters A&ndash;U (and no extraneous numbers), but this made the 7 paths very obvious, and one testsolving
        group managed to solve the meta by brute-forcing all 7! matchings of answers to paths. Another issue was that
        solvers mainly focused on analyzing the tree instead of looking for the commonality between the answers. We
        tried to
        rectify this by making an interactive game instead of an image, the intent being to discourage searching through
        the
        tree before understanding where to go, but our testers brute-forced their way through the tree to find all the
        numbers anyways.

    <p>Eventually we decided that including extraneous numbers would be the best way of addressing this issue, but it
        felt
        inelegant to have numbers that weren't used for anything. This finally led to using letters instead of numbers,
        which let us add an additional cluephrase that also told solvers to look at the answers. The cluephrase did need
        to
        include 21 specific letters in relative positions, which is why it had things like BE QUICK and GOOD JOB.

    <p>Additionally, the original version of this puzzle used tree names instead of things made of wood (we really liked
        <tt>SC<bn>HOL</bn>AR<bn>LY</bn> = <bn>HOLLY</bn> + SCAR</tt>), but at some point we noticed that it was somewhat
        similar to the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2019/problem/valentines_day_arbor_day.html">Arbor
            Day/Valentine's Day
            meta from the 2019 MH</a>. As a result, it was changed to words that could go before WOOD, like DEAD or
        SANDAL, but
        this
        aha proved too difficult in testsolving, so we finally settled on this version.

    <p>The tree presentation of this puzzle was originally intended to look like a fire, but in styling the interactive
        HTML version of it (since reading letters from the enormous-image version was a huge pain) we found it much
        easier to make something that looked like a tree than a fire.</p>
