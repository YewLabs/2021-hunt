We are presented with 10 images, each of which involve a stick figure with a question mark over their face, followed by 29 pictures of named characters or celebrities. Some of the people in the pictures share a first name; for example, there are four people named Will.
</p><p>
The key realization is that each image, when paired with one of the unique names, depicts a common phrase that can be misinterpreted as being about a named individual. For example, the fourth image, which shows a person being unlocked from a cage, depicts “FREE WILL”.
</p><p>
Indexing the number of pictures with the name into the matching phrase yields BITE UNUSED. This phrase can be applied to the one remaining picture that isn’t matched—that of Mark Zuckerberg—to produce the final answer: <span class="answer">BITE MARK</span>.
