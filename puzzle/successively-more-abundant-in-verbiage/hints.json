[[0.0, ["start"], "The long paragraphs on the right side of the puzzle may be intimidating, but try to pair them up based on similar meaning.\r\n\r\nAs for the images on the left side of the puzzle, they also come in pairs. Each pair references something that most American high schoolers will have encountered at some point."], [30.0, ["verbose"], "The paragraphs on the right side are verbosified versions of well-known quotes from literary classics, which are represented by their cover artwork or important motif (but drawn once badly, and then once even worse) on the left side.\r\n\r\nHowever, something has been modified in each of these literary quotes during the verbosification process. Try comparing what the verbatim quote says with what the verbose paragraph is trying to say."], [100.0, ["extract"], "The modified letters ordered by roman numerals spell out HEAVENLY BODY INTERSECTED PARAMOURS. As with the rest of this puzzle, try to figure out what simpler phrase this is synonymous with.\r\n\r\nIn particular, one of the literary classics appearing in this puzzle is by a famous English author, who is responsible for another literary classic that uses the above phrase to describe its main characters."]]
