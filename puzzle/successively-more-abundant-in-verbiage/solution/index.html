  This puzzle is about
  <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/increasingly-verbose-memes"
    >Increasingly Verbose</a
  >
  memes, a format in which increasingly wordy restatements of a simple phrase
  are paired with increasingly bad (or JPEG-compressed) drawings of something
  related to that phrase. This is clued by the fact that the drawings in the
  puzzle come in pairs, with the bottom image in each pair drawn worse than the
  top one, and also by the fact that the title of the puzzle, Successively More
  Abundant in Verbiage, is itself a verbosification of "increasingly verbose."
</p>
<p>
  Each pair of drawings is associated with a literary classic, either from its
  plot-related motifs or from its book cover. For example, the two first
  drawings depict guillotines, which clues <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> by
  Charles Dickens, and the last two drawings depict balls of grey twine, which
  clues <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> by Harper Lee. Each image also contains a
  distinct roman numeral from 1 to 32 inclusive. The images are sorted
  alphabetically by book title.
</p>
<p>
  However, the verbose paragraphs do not come in pairs, and it is up to the
  solver to find two verbose paragraphs for each literary classic that state a
  famous quote from that classic. In keeping with the flavor of the meme, the
  more verbose paragraph is always associated with the lower, worse-drawn image,
  and hence a larger roman numeral. But as an added twist, each paragraph is not
  a direct verbosification of the original quote, but rather of modified quote
  in which one of the words has a letter replaced. For example, this paragraph:
</p>
<p class="meme">
  It was simultaneously the superlative among coin currencies displaying benign
  properties, as well the superlative among coin currencies displaying malignant
  properties.
</p>
<p>Is a lengthier version of:</p>
<p class="meme">
  It was the best of <b>dimes</b>, it was the worst of <b>dimes</b>.
</p>
<p>
  Which is a modification of the first sentence from
  <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>. The full set of associations between verbose
  paragraphs and literary quotes is as follows.

        In subdividing the set of derri&egrave;res into logically appeasing
        categories, one can pigeonhole gluteals in twain boxes based on a
        singular discriminant-like property, namely whether the backside through
        its dialectic queries exhibits the perspective of one beseeching
        conciliation or edification, or through its dialectic responses exhibits
        the perspective of one offering denouement to the aforementioned
        beseecher.

  Sorting the modified letters based on roman numerals, we get the phrase
  HEAVENLY BODY INTERSECTED PARAMOURS. This phrase is a verbosification of the
  epithet STAR CROSSED LOVERS, meaning tragic lovers, which is best known in
  literature as an epithet for Shakespeare's
  <span class="answer">ROMEO AND JULIET</span>.

<h2>Author’s Notes</h2>

<p>I have a soft spot for puzzles about memes. Not only are memes hilarious, they also convey implicit information through imagery and position in a neatly-packed way, which is often true of puzzles as well. This puzzle was somewhat inspired by another meme puzzle: <a href="https://2018.galacticpuzzlehunt.com/puzzle/now-get-ready-for">Now Get Ready For...</a> from Galactic Puzzle Hunt 2018. Drawings images for this puzzle was hard because given my artistic skills, both the top image and the bottom image end up looking bad, yet I need the top image to look relatively <i>less</i> bad. On the other hand, writing verbose paragraphs is tremendously fun, and I had to force myself to stay under 300 characters for the shorter paragraphs, and 500 characters for the longer paragraphs.</p>

<p>For the final extraction, I knew I wanted to clue a verbosification of a quote from Romeo and Juliet, and ended up choosing HEAVENLY BODY INTERSECTED PARAMOURS because STAR CROSSED LOVERS is more than just a memorable quote, it is an epithet for the protagonists themselves. That said, I did consider alternate quotes such as I MASTICATE MY FIRST DIGIT AT THEE, or O FELICITOUS POIGNARD THINE SCABBARD IS THE FOLLOWING.</p>
