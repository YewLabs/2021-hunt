This is a puzzle about the former names of things:
<ul>
<li><b>Brad’s Drink</b> is the former name of Pepsi</li>
<li><b>Kibble</b> is the former name of Netflix</li>
<li><b>Lenny, Penny and Kenny</b> was an old working title of The Big Bang Theory</li>

<li><b>Yathrib</b> was the pre-Islam name of Medina</li>
<li><b>Smeagol</b> is what Gollum used to be called</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking the first letters of each former name, we get BKLN GRAYS. The Brooklyn Grays is a former name of the Los Angeles Dodgers, so the answer is <span class="answer">LA DODGERS</span>.</p>

<p>This puzzle was originally going to be about things that had more well-known former names, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)#/media/File:Prince_logo.svg">Prince</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.">Alphabet</a>, but this direction ended up being more interesting.</p></div>
