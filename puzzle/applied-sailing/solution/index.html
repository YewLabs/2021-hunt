<p>This puzzle happened in the Projection Device and was
unlocked after teams completed the Sailing Event on
Friday evening. Teams must go to the Sailing Pavilion through
the Projection Device, upon which they discover an
egregious number of lobsters crowding the river.
Team members have to collaborate to push around the lobsters
until they can see the clams underneath. The clams
spell the answer to this puzzle, which is
<span class="answer">FOOLISH</span>.
