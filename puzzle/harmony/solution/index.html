<p>
This puzzle combines the four elements of the <i>Avatar</i> universe with the
four steps of an &ldquo;Identify, Sort, Index, Solve&rdquo; puzzle, and more
vaguely with a few different common puzzle formats.
</p>

<p>
The left column of the table corresponds to the element of water and the
&ldquo;identify&rdquo; step of ISIS. Each list is a set of related things with one missing;
that one is related to water in some way. The rest have been replaced with the
alphabetically previous and next words in a dictionary.

<p><small>
Note for pedantic readers: while <tt>/usr/share/dict/words</tt> provides the
wordlist used, the ordering doesn&rsquo;t always match exactly. I tried to skip
words that would be considered forms or compounds of the clued word, while
allowing those that were merely etymologically related, but this is ambiguous
in the presence of multi-word phrases and Greek gods (how closely is
&ldquo;Hermaphroditus&rdquo; derived from &ldquo;Hermes&rdquo;?). So extracting
a rigorous dictionary order isn&rsquo;t expected or needed.

<p>
The middle column of the table corresponds to the element of earth and the
&ldquo;index&rdquo; step of ISIS. Each panel depicts an alternate version of Spider-Man,
the original &ldquo;web comic&rdquo;. Marvel comics give every alternate universe a
numbered designation; the ones used here all have four digits, so they can be
matched to the four letters in the speech bubble, two of which are indicated
per panel. The copyright indicates the year of the universe&rsquo;s first appearance.

The right column of the table corresponds to the element of fire and the
&ldquo;sort&rdquo; step of ISIS. The eight song titles appear in eight consecutive lines
from &ldquo;Ring of Fire&rdquo; by June Carter Cash/Johnny Cash, which provides an ordering.
</p>

  <td>Burn</td>
  <td>Hamilton</td>
  <td>And it BURNs, BURNs, BURNs</td>

<p>
Now we can combine the elements. Each row should be considered a unit; they are
initially ordered alphabetically by song title. Use the answers from water,
index by the digits from earth, and reorder by the lines from fire to find what
Aang values most: the <tt>FREEDOMS OF THE AIR</tt>. These are a numbered
categorization of rights granted by countries to airlines from other countries.
A list can be found on Wikipedia or other places online.

<p>
The air/&ldquo;solve&rdquo; step is itself a mini-ISIS. Each diary entry indicates both an
episode of <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i> and a specific freedom of the air
exercised by the characters. To be unambiguous, only events specified in the
entry should be considered, not any others in the same episode; as the diary is
written from Aang and Appa&rsquo;s perspective, air temples count as the home country
(for The Boiling Rock, using Hakoda&rsquo;s perspective gives the same result). The
entries are given in alphabetical order by episode title.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <td>2-16</td>
  <td>Appa&rsquo;s Lost Days</td>
  <td>6: from one country (fire) to home (air) to another (earth)</td>
  <td>L</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>3-09</td>
  <td>Nightmares and Daydreams</td>
  <td>2: refuel without embarking or disembarking passengers</td>
  <td>I</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2-01</td>
  <td>The Avatar State</td>
  <td>7: from one foreign country (water) to another (earth)</td>
  <td>T</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>3-14</td>
  <td>The Boiling Rock, Part 1</td>
  <td>9: between two points within another country (fire)</td>
  <td>N</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2-08</td>
  <td>The Chase</td>
  <td>8: within a foreign country (earth) having started at home (air)</td>
  <td>E</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1-11</td>
  <td>The Great Divide</td>
  <td>1: cross another country (earth) without landing</td>
  <td>T</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1-03</td>
  <td>The Southern Air Temple</td>
  <td>4: from another country (water) to home (air)</td>
  <td>S</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>3-16</td>
  <td>The Southern Raiders</td>
  <td>3: from home (air) to another country (fire)</td>
  <td>E</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1-18</td>
  <td>The Waterbending Master</td>
  <td>5: from home (air) to one country (earth) to another (water)</td>
  <td>A</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Finally: identifying the episodes and freedoms, sorting chronologically as
indicated, and indexing the freedom number into the episode title produces the
answer <span class="answer">STATE LINE</span>, a concept definitely relevant to freedoms of
the air and arguably also to events following the finale of <i>Avatar</i>.

As you can probably guess, this was originally four separate puzzle ideas
that got glommed together. Thematic coherence? What&rsquo;s that?
