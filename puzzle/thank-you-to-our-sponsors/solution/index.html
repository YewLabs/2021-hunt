<p>Solvers are presented with 15 descriptions of anonymous donations made to the Mystery Hunt. Each description indicates the amount of money donated and also contains clues as to the donor’s identity, which is always a notable fictional character. By identifying a few donors and googling them, we can realize that all 15 donors are fictional characters on the 2013 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mlg45edmmd/1-scrooge-mcduck/#5a66b10f6f8b">Forbes Fictional 15</a> list (the most recent list, as mentioned by the flavortext).</p>

<p>As clued by the flavortext, each donation is an integer percentage of the character’s estimated net worth. The descriptions are ordered by the amount of money donated, from least to greatest. Converting the percentages to letters (1 = A, 2 = B, …) and re-sorting the list by the characters’ net worths yields the cluephrase UK MONEY TWO WORDS. The answer to the puzzle is then <span class="answer">POUND STERLING</span>.</p>
