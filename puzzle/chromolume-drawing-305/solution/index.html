<p>This puzzle is an homage to the 2018 Mystery Hunt puzzle <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/2018/full/puzzle/floor_drawing_305.html">Floor Drawing 305</a>. That puzzle, written in the style of Sol Lewitt’s <a href="https://massmoca.org/event/walldrawing305/">Wall Drawing 305</a>, was a runaround puzzle using Sol Lewitt’s <a href="https://listart.mit.edu/public-art-map/bars-color-within-squares-mit">Bars of Color Within Squares</a>, which is installed in MIT Building 6C.</p>

<p>The first thing to realize about this puzzle is that the images described are <i>not</i> Bars of Color; they are famous paintings. (The puzzle's title hints at this: “Chromolume #7” is a song in the musical <i>Sunday in the Park with George</i>, which is about Georges Seurat, who painted the fourth painting described, <i>A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte</i>. Seurat’s style is known as <i>pointillism</i>, which is appropriate for this puzzle.)</p>

<p>Following the same mechanic as the 2018 puzzle, you have to match a paragraph describing the locations of points and a paragraph describing how to draw lines on each painting. The drawing paragraphs are in alphabetical order, but the point paragraphs aren’t, which suggests the point paragraph order is important.</p>

<p>These are the paintings and paragraph pairs, in the order given in the top half, with points and lines drawn on each one:</p>

<h3>The Birth of Venus - Botticelli, Sandro</h3>

<img class="artwork" src="{{sroot}}p1.jpg" alt="Image of The Birth of Venus with four points overlaid, with lines drawing out a U">

<p>The first point is the lowest point where pink, gold, blue, and dark green regions meet. The second point is located approximately where several orange strands meet blue, pink, and beige regions. The third point is located at the triple point where a blue region meets beige and greenish brown regions below it. The fourth point is located at the point where two beige-black edges form a right angle on a shell.</p>

<p>Draw a nearly horizontal line between the first and fourth points. Draw a line from the second point to the second-closest point. Draw a line from the third point to the nearest end of the first line you drew.</p>

<h3>Girl With A Pearl Earring - Vermeer, Johannes</h3>

<p>The first point is the lowest point where a small yellow region is surrounded by many small, bright white regions. The second point is located at the rightmost point where two black lines are blue-blue edges and form a right angle. The third point is located at the prominent blue-dark blue-white triple point directly below the rightmost swirl. The fourth point is located at the midpoint of the missing edge of the yellow crescent. The fifth point is located at the point where two curved green-gray edges meet just to the left of a large black region. The sixth point is located at the tip of the black spire.</p>

<p>Draw a line from the first point to the nearest even-numbered point. Draw a line from the second point to the nearest point. Draw a line from the third point to the point located almost directly to the left of it. Draw a line from the fourth point to the farthest point for which this line will not pass through any previously drawn line. Draw a line from the fifth point back to the second point.</p>

<h3>Rideau, Cruchon et Compotier - Cezanne, Paul</h3>

<img class="artwork" src="{{sroot}}p6.jpg" alt="Image of Rideau, Cruchon et Compotier with five points overlaid, with lines drawing out a I">

<p>The first point is the triple point where an edible green region meets a white-brown edge.

The third point is located at the point where two gray-gray edges meet right above a near-circle on a jug. The fourth point is located at the triple point where a white region is to the left of a shadowed white region and a shadowed brown region. The fifth point is located at the topmost point where two green-orange edges meet.</p>

<p>Draw lines from the first and second points to the point that is between them. Draw a line from the third point to the point above the first point. Draw a line from the fourth point to the center of a previously drawn line.</p>

<h3>Composition VIII - Kandinsky, Wassily</h3>

<img class="artwork" src="{{sroot}}p7.jpg" alt="Image of Composition VIII with five points overlaid, with lines drawing out a M">

<hr>

<p>We can see that the lines on each painting clearly form a letter (and that they are given in order of year painted, which can help with identification):</p>

<h2>Author’s Notes</h2>

    <p>Around the time ideas were solicited for this round, I listened to the soundtrack of <i>Sunday in the Park With George</i> on a long drive. In stage productions of the musical, the characters in the painting come to life and walk out onto the stage, and I had the idea of a “runaround” where you walk around within (or even between) paintings. Eventually, that idea ended up becoming this one, based on one of my favorite puzzles from the 2018 Mystery Hunt. It’s possible to solve this puzzle with no knowledge of either the musical or the other puzzle, but I hope both homages contribute to solvers’ enjoyment.</p>
