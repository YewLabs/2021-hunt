  The &perp;IW.nano round had a peculiar unlocking structure. When solvers first opened the round, it was entitled &perp;IW.giga and the metapuzzle for that round—Rule of Three—was already solved. Solvers needed to determine that one of the puzzles in the round—Twins—was impossible to solve normally and must be backsolved from the meta. When this puzzle was backsolved, the website allowed solvers to “zoom in” to &perp;IW.kilo, a whole new round with Twins as the metapuzzle.

  Solvers then needed to repeat this process and backsolve a particular puzzle in &perp;IW.kilo to enter &perp;IW.milli. Finally, in &perp;IW.milli, solvers found that one of the individual puzzles was titled &perp;IW.nano. Backsolving &perp;IW.nano completed the entire round and fixed the &perp;IW.nano building.

As stated above, this puzzle was automatically solved with the correct answer the moment the &perp;IW.giga round was unlocked.
