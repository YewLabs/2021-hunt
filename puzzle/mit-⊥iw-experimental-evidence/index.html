<p>Yew Labs is trying to understand some of the problems at ⊥IW by comparing their versions of things to those at MIT. As with any experiment, they also need a control group to compare with. Below is a list of 70 things that we’d like examples of. We already have examples from MIT and from ⊥IW, so please bring <b>other examples we haven’t seen before</b>.

<p>The number we’ll need depends on your team size; bigger teams need more research success to justify their work to funding agencies. We need at least <span role="math">\(\frac{n}{3}+\frac{\sqrt{n}}{2} + 13\)</span> research points, rounded up, where <span role="math">\(n\)</span> is your registered team size. (As a reminder, your registered team size is {{puzzle.team.size_int|default:"unknown"}}, so you need <b>{{puzzle.team.size_int | scav_hunt_points}} research points</b>.) Most items on the list are worth 1 research point, but a few are worth more and are indicated as such.

<p>You may also present one of your items as a <b>breakthrough discovery</b>! If the committee agrees that it truly revolutionizes the field, they may award it up to 4 extra research points.

<p>Prepare a <b>Google Photos or Dropbox link</b> containing <b>picture or video evidence</b> of each of your items. Each file must be <b>labeled with the item number</b> and depict the item as well as a member of your team <b>holding a sign that says MYST2021</b>. Once you’ve done that, your committee will <b>schedule a Zoom call</b> with you where the committee chair will share their screen and examine your evidence. Please be prepared to defend your findings. {{ submission_instructions|safe }}

<p>We ask that you avoid scheduling a call before you are fairly confident that you’ll pass. (You wouldn’t want to waste your committee’s time.)

<p>Please do not do anything illegal, immoral, dangerous, or that would disappoint Professor Yew.

<div class="fourthwall">If you’re new around here, welcome! This is the obligatory MIT Mystery Hunt scavenger hunt. Traditionally, teams have to scrounge up creative submissions for the prompts using whatever they can gather around their headquarters. This year, we’re doing submissions virtually, but we still expect you to produce physical items. They don’t all have to be in one place; anyone on your team can contribute. In this puzzle, for as many of the below MIT-themed prompts as you like, you should produce a submission that you can pass off as that thing, without actually using the real thing on or from MIT campus. While we will be checking your score against the goal listed above, we’ll be lenient about accepting submissions as long as you’ve put effort toward satisfying the prompt and the rules. Good luck!</div>
