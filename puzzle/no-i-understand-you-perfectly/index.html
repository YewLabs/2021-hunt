<span class="blue">-Personally, I think the government is pretty bad.<br></span>
<span class="black">-Yeah, the mold is kinda terrible. But hey, you can't have blue cheese without it though.<br></span>
<span class="blue">-Mit&auml;? What are you saying? You don't understand me at all, do you?<br></span>
</p>

<div class="blue">Yeah? Well I doubt it. Anyway, do you see that old stronghold over there?</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="black">Umm, maybe? Like I wouldn&rsquo;t call it a town, but I think I know what you mean.</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="blue">Why not? It&rsquo;s a fortified location. It&rsquo;s obviously a stronghold.</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="black">Huh, I didn&rsquo;t know that towns have to be that well defended. But I do know that according to local legend, the walls of that thing can randomly give off a magic spark that sets fire to valuable items. You might wanna try and stay clear.</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="blue">Huh. And I always thought that radii were just mathematical concepts.</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="black">No, they&rsquo;re quite real. Although magic sparks are probably just a fantasy.</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="blue">Yeah. They&rsquo;re the product of a mathematician who got bored and made stuff up for their own amusement.</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="black">Well that&rsquo;s what mathematicians do. They find an interesting problem, and then work on it. If you need to make something up, that&rsquo;s also great if you can bring it in line with the rest of math.</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="blue">Yeah, but I doubt the mathematicians make something up just because it&rsquo;s funny.</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="black">They usually don&rsquo;t, and I fail to see how our previous discussion implied that in any way. Though I know a mathematician back at TalTech who liked thinking about a teapot without its spout.</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="blue">So you&rsquo;re saying that the teapot was damaged? Or that it wasn&rsquo;t used as a teapot?</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="black">Neither. Mathematicians don&rsquo;t usually concern themselves with mundane trivialities like the real world. Speaking of which, you do have a ride back to civilization, right?</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="blue">Yep. I have a fine stallion that we can ride back home.</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="black">Wait, what? I thought that was banned in literally all of Europe. And you&rsquo;re planning on riding one?</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="blue">Umm, yeah, that&rsquo;s what horses are for. Ain&rsquo;t nothing illegal about having them either. Though before we go, here, have some milk.</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="black">Oh thanks. Wow, you must love lean dairy.</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="blue">Nah, I make it myself. I do live on a farm you know. Oh, the horse is here. Let&rsquo;s get going.</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="black">Nice. By the way, do you have a radio at your farm? There&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;d like to listen to soon.</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="blue">Yeah, I actually have a shed with some old radios.</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="black">Why would you require old radios? Anyway, it&rsquo;s okay if you can&rsquo;t spare anything. I&rsquo;ll just hope for the best.</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="blue">Huh, no, I just told you I have a bunch of them. I can just lend you one if you need it.</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="black">Oh, thanks. Hey, that cloud over there looks like a bear.</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="blue">What&rsquo;s so special about that? All clouds are a bit rugged in my opinion.</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="black">Eh, maybe, if you look at them right. Hey, that one&rsquo;s a ship.</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="blue">Oh. My mother barely survived a shipwreck. It stressed her out so much she&rsquo;s bald now.</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="black">Oh, I&rsquo;m so sorry about that. Though I feel like you made the second part up. That sort of stuff only happens in Greek mythology. Besides, I think Medusa would be to blame, if that actually happened.</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="blue">Look, I know it&rsquo;s uncommon in women, but it&rsquo;s a thing that actually happens. You must be lucky to have never experienced it yourself. Anyway, here we are, I&rsquo;ll go grab a radio for you.</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="black">Hey, remember when we were talking about mold?</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="blue">Yeah, and then you started ranting about blue cheese. I still have no idea what the connection is.</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="black">Like, it&rsquo;s an ingredient. You put the right mold on the right cheese and you get blue cheese, just like that.</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="blue">You must be joking. Anyway here&rsquo;s your radio.</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="black"><i>6, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 7</i></div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="blue">Huh. What does it mean?</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="black">That&rsquo;s unfortunately a secret. Anyway, it&rsquo;s getting late and I&rsquo;m tired. Goodnight, my friend.</div><br class="no-copy">

<div class="blue">Are we really friends? We really seem to misunderstand each other a lot. In any case, goodnight.</div><br class="no-copy">
