<p>These are all excerpts from famous poems, where every word has been replaced with a (fairly exactly) rhyming word, or occasionally a made-up hyphenated word. This is hinted at by the title, which rhymes with &ldquo;rhyme and reason&rdquo;. Other potential break-ins to this step include the weird hyphenated words like &ldquo;mid-dint&rdquo; (rhymes with &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t&rdquo;) or &ldquo;pig-current&rdquo; (rhymes with &ldquo;ignorant&rdquo;), as well as some of the more notable poems like &ldquo;Kubla Khan&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The table below lists the poems and corresponding excerpts, where the word in the same spot as the blanks is capitalized.</p>

<p>For consistency and to aid in identification, all formatting and punctuation, and most capitalization, is the same as the original poem.</p>

<p>Now, we can look at the blanks. If we try to fill them with the missing word from the original poem, it often doesn&rsquo;t fit &mdash; for example, the second excerpt has 5 blanks but the missing word is PALLOR. The final realization is that each of these missing words has exactly one compelling rhyme in the English language, which fits in the blanks (e.g. PALLOR only rhymes with VALOR).</p>

<p>We can now fill in these rhyming words and extract the highlighted letters:</p>

<p>These letters spell out MANGLE PACKETS. We repeat the rhyming one more time to get a good two-word phrase: <span class="answer">ANGLE BRACKETS</span>.</p>

<h2>Authorsâ€™ Notes</h2>

<p>We ideated and wrote the first draft of this puzzle in three hours. Anderson wanted to rhyme each word or syllable in a poem and Brian had had Wikipedia&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_closed_pairs_of_English_rhyming_words">List of closed pairs of English rhyming words</a> on his list of puzzle ideas for a while.</p>

<p>This list turns out to be not entirely accurate and quite incomplete.</p>

<p>At first we thought pairs were fairly rare, but it turns out that picking a poet and reading their works, focusing on two-syllable words with the stress on the first syllable, actually has a decent chance of hitting upon a random word with exactly one other compelling rhyme. Using this strategy, we were eventually able to find enough excerpts that we felt would be recognizable by a poetry enthusiast (or whose style was recognizable even if the lines aren&rsquo;t as famous, in the case of Dickinson and Whitman).</p>
