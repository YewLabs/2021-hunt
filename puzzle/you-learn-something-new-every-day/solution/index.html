<p>The flavortext (and the title, to some extent) strongly suggests at looking at LearnedLeague's <a href="https://www.learnedleague.com/oneday/">One-Day Specials</a>. These are 12-question trivia quizzes typically written by members of the community, for the community. They come in a variety of topics, including MIT, which is where we start first.</p>

<p>Filling in each section's answers and then reading the numbered blanks in order reveals the name of another One-Day. We can continue running around the One-Days until the very end, where we reach the Paradoxes 1DS.</p>

<p>We can read off the boxed blanks to get the instruction DIAGONAL OF FINAL ONE DAY. Step 52 tells us to apply this instruction on the questions of Paradoxes 1DS. Doing so gives us the instruction WRITE A ONE DAY. Teams that did this received the answer <span class="answer">QUIZMASTER</span>.</p>

<p>This was a highly experimental 1DS where the subject of the one-day was announced about one week in advance, the small town of Owasa, Iowa. The intent was that almost nobody would have known any information about the town in advance, and therefore this was a test to see how effectively players could gather information about the town and retain the information.</p>

    <tr><td><ol start="27"><li>Who is twelfth (and would be thirteenth if the list were remade today)?</li></ol></td><td>MACMILLAN</td><td>This refers to Q6. When the 1DS ran in 2016, Theresa May was the UK Prime Minister, though as of 2021 the prime minister is her successor, Boris Johnson, which explains why this particular list is no longer up to date. Going back to the thirteenth most recent PM, we get Harold Macmillan. Since the sequence clues surnames only, we should answer with Macmillan.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><ol start="28"><li>What might come fifth, despite neither fitting the pattern nor the personhood of the ones before it?</li></ol></td><td>BIRTHDAY PARTY</td><td>This refers to Q11. In verse 3 of the lyrics to <i>It's the End of the World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)</i>, the four L.B.'s in the sequence are enumerated. The list keeps going, although no longer sticking to the L.B. theme (Birthday party, cheesecake, jelly bean, boom!), thus making the non-person answer "Birthday Party".</td></tr>

<h2>Authorsâ€™ Notes</h2>

    <p>Lewis: The Paradoxes 1DS ran on February 13, 2020 and was written by me. Just like in writing puzzles, LearnedLeague one-days also have a formalized process for testing, scheduled several weeks before the 1DS goes live. Practically, this meant that I had to generally set my question answers mid-January, and finalize my questions early February. Since we were still deciding on the hunt theme and other planning logistics only 2&ndash;3 weeks after we won (and in particular nowhere near finalizing any metas or answers), that restricted this puzzle to having a "perform a task" phrase.</p>

    <p>The set of question answers was generally fixed, and there was more freedom to produce a message in the question bodies. Combined with the ability to order the questions in pretty much any order (My main soft constraint was that I wanted to open the quiz with a relatively easy question), it was not too hard to eventually make the message, even if the wordings of the questions suffered a little. Diagonalization felt particularly fitting, given the Cantor diagonalization argument being... sort of adjacent to paradoxes, I guess.</p>

    <p>There were several ideas for this puzzle. Among these included one which used the names of the various leagues in LearnedLeague, and perhaps even using the colored roundels. Another idea involved drawing lines on the calendar. Ultimately we went with this idea for the relative ease of construction and also a size that isn't too grindy, yet still reasonably substantial. This did mean that we needed to quite heavily clue 1DS for those who didn't already know the subject matter.</p>

    <p>For the most part, topics were chosen for their puzzling nature. (Also, quite a few of these topics have sequels, though we stuck to the original 1DS in all cases.) Some other ones that weren't picked but are still notable:
