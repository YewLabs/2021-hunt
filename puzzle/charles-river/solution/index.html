<p>Each node represents a different word transformation that we apply in sequence. The transformations are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Reverse string (decal &rarr; laced)</li>
  <li>Add “re” to the start of the word (fuse &rarr; refuse)</li>
  <li>Replace last letter with the previous letter in the alphabet (i.e. mast &rarr; mass)</li>
  <li>Convert the word to its pig latin form (trash &rarr; ashtray)</li>
  <li>Take a homophone of the word (allowed &rarr; aloud)</li>
  <li>Take an antonym of the word (big &rarr; small)</li>
  <li>Add the substring “tor” to the word in any location (real &rarr; realtor)</li>
  <li>Remove the suffix of the word (policing &rarr; police)</li>
</ol>


<p>We get a word as input and then apply some number of transformations on it until we get an output word. Notably, all the intermediate strings are also words. After you know the transformations, you can use the four answers you got from the events as input words and get four output words. In order, we have: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Sailing: FOOLISH</li>
  <li>Archery: PAID</li>
  <li>Pistol: DUO</li>
  <li>Fencing: FACIAL</li>
</ol>

The corresponding transformations are:

<ol>
  <li>FOOLISH &rarr; FOOL &rarr; SAGE &rarr; STORAGE</li>
  <li>PAID &rarr; REPAID &rarr; DIAPER</li>
  <li>DUO &rarr; DUN &rarr; DONE &rarr; ONEDAY</li>
  <li>FACIAL &rarr; FACTORIAL &rarr; FACTOR &rarr; REFACTOR</li>
</ol>

And if we take the relevant letters, we spell out the answer,
<span class="answer">PIRATE SONG</span>.
