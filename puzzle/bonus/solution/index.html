<p>This bonus event happened on Sunday at 1pm EST. Teams were
told to send 0 or 1 participants who like art. Participants
were split into groups of size ~20 and given slices of a
famous painting, photo or picture to draw. After slices of
the picture were drawn, a moderator puts them into a
Google doc and allows the participants to re-arrange the slices
in order to try to recreate and recognize what the image
is.</p>

<p>Afterwards, each group tries to ID the arranged mosaics
drawn by the other groups. Each group gets 1 point for each
image they correctly ID and also for each group that correctly IDs
their own image. </p>

<p>At the end of the event, participants are given the answer
to the event, which is 
<span class="answer">PINEAPPLE</span>.
They need to enter this answer in order to get the prize
for this bonus event, which is 100 JUICE for every round.
