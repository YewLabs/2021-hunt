<p>In this round, puzzles are presented as locations on a computer terminal of sorts, and the meta itself shows the “keyboard” of this terminal, which is a standard QWERTY keyboard layout, but with the letters all presented in seven-segment displays.</p>

<p>There are several hints at how to proceed here. The presentation of the keys is a little odd, and solvers may notice that some of the symbols are flips of each other (or themselves). Also, the distribution of letters in the answers is a little odd, and coincides with the letters on the keyboard that can be flipped. Additionally, the flavor text and storyline up until this point discusses going from “MIT” to “&perp;IW”, which clues the idea of rotating by 180 degrees.</p>

<p>Each answer in this round, when flipped using the custom font, becomes another common word with a single extra letter. The answers are ordered by their puzzle’s position on the interface after everything has been rotated (as if turning the entire interface upside down).</p>

<p>Reading the extra letters in order gives the answer to this puzzle, and the question to be settled before entering the virtual world: <span class="answer">TWO-D OR NOT TWO-D</span>?</p>

<h2>Authors’ Notes</h2>
<p>At some point fairly early on in brainstorming, one of our team members suggested to call the “alternate MIT” the &perp;IW. This gave a very natural idea for this introductory meta, to use flipping letters as a twist. </p>

<p>However, without additional context, it isn’t really clear how to flip most letters to make other letters, beyond a few clear cases (eg. W &harr; M), and there aren’t enough such letters to make reasonable words.</p>

<p>To make this work, Colin had the idea of styling the round as a computer terminal of sorts, and using the seven-segment displays to both indicate and clue the rotation mechanic.</p>

<p>The specifics of this puzzle went through several iterations, some also using the fact that letters can be made into numbers via rotation. We settled on this version, which seemed to be at an appropriate level of difficulty for the first meta of the hunt, and anyway allowed for much better answers than some of the more complicated versions.</p>
