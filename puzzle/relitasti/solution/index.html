<p>This is a puzzle about pasta, which as everyone knows, is really tasty (&ldquo;relitasti&rdquo;)!</p>

<p>Each of the boxes depicts a fictional type of pasta ending in &ldquo;i&rdquo;. Arrange the provided word fragments on the labels of the boxes. Two things that help with this are: (1) the pasta types are ordered alphabetically; (2) the width of an empty space on a label corresponds with the number of letters in the matching fragment. The three unused fragments are EN TRO PI aka <span class="answer">ENTROPY</span>.</p>
