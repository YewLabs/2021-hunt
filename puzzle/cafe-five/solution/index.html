<p>In this puzzle, you just follow the instructions and answer the questions. The questions themselves range from very easy ("What is 3 + 4?") to complex logic puzzles. </p>

<p>With 25 minutes remaining, a special event occurs — L. Rafael Reif approaches the cafe for some lunch! Reif's puzzle is a huge double logic puzzle, requires two comps to dismiss, and has a 21-minute time limit.</p>

<p>Puzzles are bucketed into four difficulty levels: "easy", "medium", "hard", and "boss", and puzzles within each level are treated identically. Customers come in at a rate dependent on the amount of time left on the clock. This rate is gently accelerated as teams got closer to winning.</p>

<p>Once the clock runs out, you gets a token which can be used to get the answer to any one Cafe Five puzzle in the Infinite Corridor. You'll have to play again to get more tokens!</p>

<h2>Authors’ Notes</h2>
    <p>This puzzle was originally submitted to the 2019 Galactic Puzzle Hunt. We decided to cut it since it was too similar to <a href="https://2019.galacticpuzzlehunt.com/puzzle/race-for-the-galaxy.html">Race for the Galaxy</a>, another randomly-generated puzzle gauntlet.</a> Luckily, the Infinite Corridor round format turned out to be a perfect fit for this puzzle!</p>
    <p>The puzzle was inspired by <a href="https://ipsc.ksp.sk/2018/real/problems/m.html">McDroid's</a>, a similar puzzle from an online programming contest. The concept remains exactly the same, but turned out to be tricky to execute without it becoming tedious or irritating. We went through a lot of design iterations, but we're happy with where it ended up.</p>
    <p>While we were writing Mystery Hunt, one of the authors of this puzzle (Nathan) recycled this idea again and made <a href="https://npinsker.itch.io/normal-diner">Normal Diner</a> for a game jam. It's plagiarism all the way down :^)</p>
    <p>We ended up with 373 "easy" questions, 140 "medium" questions, 28 "hard" questions, and 5 "boss" questions, for a total of 546 questions. An incredibly large THANK YOU to the members of our team who fact-checked and contributed questions to this puzzle!!</p>
