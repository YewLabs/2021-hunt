<h2>Authorsâ€™ Notes</h2>
    <p>Since there weren't any other projection device runarounds in the hunt at the time, we wrote this puzzle as a light runaround. We hoped people who had gotten familiar with the Projection Device would have a little opportunity to get rewarded for it.</p>

    <p>When you fix the Green Building, the vines on the roof don't disappear, purely so that we could put the cat out on the vines for this specific puzzle, because we thought it was such a cool reveal.</p>

    <p>The cat on the Green Building is DD's fan art of the main character in <a href="https://cluedo.itch.io/keyboard-kitten">Keyboard Kitten</a>, a small puzzle game made by Anderson and Colin for a game jam. Anderson uses this cat as his Discord avatar, so we named the cat "Nyanderson".</p>

    <p>Asking someone for a "stud finder" and getting the response "sounds like you need a stud finder finder" is a common joke on the distinguished MIT mailing list, ec-discuss@.</p>
