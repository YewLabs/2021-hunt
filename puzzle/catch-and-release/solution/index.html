<p>In this puzzle, you're tasked with catching 80% of the fish at &perp;IW. There are a total of 5 pools of fish spread throughout the Institute. Each pool has its own rule governing which fish you catch; you'll need to figure out these rules to catch all the fish in each location.</p>

<p>Each pool has a fishing notebook next to it, showing your overall progress and which fish you've caught in each area. Pools also each have a non-player character nearby, who hints at how to catch the fish. These characters' hints will be <i>italicized</i> below.</p>

<i>"I can't catch any fish! I hear lobsters like having people around..."</i>
</p>

<p>This hints at other people being the key to catching fish here. Some experimentation (i.e. calling your teammates over to fish with you) will yield different types of fish. The fish you catch here is governed by the number of teammates in the scene: having one teammate in this scene will only result in trash, but having two through seven teammates will result in catching the six unique smobsters in this pool. (Having eight or more teammates will give the same result as seven.)</p>

<i>"This lake changes color...wild."</i>
</p>

<p>"Changing color" is the key to the fish here. You can change either your hair color or your visor color, and experimenting will demonstrate that it's your hair color that controls the fish you catch. Depending on your hair color of choice &#8212; red, orange, yellow, green, blue, or purple &#8212; you'll catch a fish that (roughly) corresponds with that color.</p>

<i>"Oh man, there are Pok&eacute;mon in this pool! I just caught a Tentacool (072) and a Staryu (120)! Come to think of it...I just entered those into the Lobby 10 clusters keypad..."</i>
</p>

<p>The key here is the suggestion to enter the numbers into the Lobby 10 clusters keypad. Because of the way that keypad works, in order to enter a number you must press the '#' key between every digit press. When you enter in either 072 or 120, the keypad will flash green, suggesting you're on the right track. You can then go back to the fishing pool and fish up the Pok&eacute;mon corresponding to those Pok&eacute;dex numbers.</p>

<p>To catch the rest of the Pok&eacute;mon, you need to identify their species from the provided silhouette. (Noticing that they're all water Pok&eacute;mon speeds up the search significantly.) Then repeat the same process: enter each (National) Pok&eacute;dex number into the nearby Cluster keypad, then return to the fishing spot and fish the corresponding Pok&eacute;mon up.</p>

<table class="listing">

</p>

<p>This student hints at "talking to others", so you should start by talking to someone nearby. After some experimentation, you may notice you'll catch something if you talked to someone before casting your line. To catch all the fish, the key is to keep talking to more and more people, and fishing directly after each one. As you keep talking to new people and then fishing, you'll catch more and more glorious Cakefish. (On your seventh new person, you'll catch the rarest fish, the Mature Cakefish.)</p>

<p>More specifically, after you talk to someone in the Student Center area and then fish, they're permanently assigned a number. The first such person will get the number 1, the second person gets 2, and so on. The fish you catch depends on the number of the last person you talked to: with a number of 1 or 2, you'll get a Sproutling; with 3 or 4, a Cakefishling, and so on, until you catch a Mature Cakefish with a number of 7 or more.</p>

<tr><th>Sproutling</th><td><img src="{{sroot}}sproutling.png"></td><td>Evolves into Cakefishling when immersed into a frothy bowl of whipped cream.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Cakefish</th><td><img src="{{sroot}}cakefish.png"></td><td>A common Cakefish, delicious and moist.<br>Don't confuse it with the common fishcake!</td></tr>
<tr><th>Mature Cakefish</th><td><img src="{{sroot}}mature_cakefish.png"></td><td>Its whipped cream is the stuff of legends. One bite and all other desserts will be erased from your mind.</td></tr>

</p>

<p>The fish you catch here is determined by the number of seconds you wait between seeing the "!" symbol and reeling in. The fish on the journal page are sorted by how long you have to wait, so once you've caught most of them, it isn't too hard to nail down the remaining few.</p>
