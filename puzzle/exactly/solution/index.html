<p>This is a puzzle about suspiciously exact numbers in fiction.</p>

<p>First, we start filling in the blanks. One good place to start is with some of the more distinct "words" like
    WHATSIT, BUMI, ELOI, etc. We notice that each of these is a number from a fictional universe.</p>

<p>Once we've solved most of the clues, we might notice that the numbers are in increasing numerical order, helping us
    place the rest of them.</p>

<p>When we've solved all the clues, we can fill the numbers into the equation at the bottom:</p>
$$N+\frac{B(M+H)}{C}+E*\left\lfloor F-\gcd(G,P)*\log_{AJ}
O\right\rfloor-\frac{I}{D}+K-L$$
$$=9906753+\frac{42(8675309+24601)}{84}+88*\left\lfloor 394-\gcd(451,01189998819991197253)*\log_{\frac{525000}{3721}}
2379152497\right\rfloor$$
$$-\frac{69105}{85}+528491-802701$$
$$=9906753+\frac{8699910}{2}+88*\left\lfloor 394-41*4.36214\ldots\right\rfloor-813-274210$$
$$=9906753+4349955+88*215-275023$$
$$=9906753+4349955+18920-275023$$
$$=14000605$$
<p>So we can conclude that <span class="equation">14000605 = __ __
        BY <span class="box">___ ___</span></span>. <br> <br>Googling the number if we don't recognize it, we can find that it is
    the number of <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-saw-14000605-futures">FUTURES SEEN BY DOCTOR STRANGE</a> in
    <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>. Thus, the answer is <span class="answer">DOCTOR
        STRANGE</span>.</p>

<h2>Authorsâ€™ Notes</h2>
    <p>
        Two of these numbers are easy to get wrong. The CHANCE OF SUCCESSFULLY NAVIGATING AN ASTEROID FIELD is,
        according to C-3PO, approximately 3,720 to 1. This corresponds to a \(\frac{1}{3721}\) chance, but it can easily
        be misparsed to mean \(\frac{1}{3720}\). The number of MOMENTS SO DEAR is, according to <i>Rent</i>, 525,000.
        This is 600 short of the number of minutes in a year, the more famous number in the song. However, either of
        these numbers can be set to either the correct value or the incorrect one and the equation still resolves to the
        same number.</p>
    <p>Both when constructing this puzzle and testsolving it, we came across the limitation of Google Sheets that it
        cannot deal with integers as large as 01189998819991197253, so it ends up interpreted as either a string or a
        float, both of which yield incorrect GCD values.</p>
    <p>Some numbers we didn't get to include but considered include ORCS ON A MUNCHKIN CARD, POWER LEVEL LOWER BOUND,
        MILES
        I WOULD WALK and CHANCE OF SURVIVAL FOR LEEROY JENKINS.</p>
