<p>This puzzle involves walking around &perp;IW to locations that have an X on the ground. First, we must figure out which
    scene with an X fits each instruction. Then, we can follow the instructions, starting from the X, and draw lines to spell 
    out a letter on the ground, viewed from the perspective of the bottom-right corner of the screen.</p>
