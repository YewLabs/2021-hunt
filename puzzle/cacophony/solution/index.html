    <p>We are presented with a video made up of three second clips. The majority of the clips have Yakety Sax playing, but a few do not. Notably, these clips are the first and last clips, and a number of clips that are simply of a stump with a sign that says "I'm John".</p>

    <p>The John Stump clips clue, well, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stump">John Stump</a>, a satirical composer. In particular, this puzzle refers to his work <a href="{{sroot}}faeries-aire.gif">Faerie's Aire and Death Waltz</a>, as indicated by the first and last clips.</p>

    <p>Once we have identified the work that this video is referring to, we find the clips match with the strange and amusing markings of the piece. Tracing a path from marking to marking in the order of the clips in the video spells a letter, with letter breaks indicated by the John Stump clip.</p>
