    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>
        The title suggests that these are cryptic clues, and indeed they are. However they aren't exactly 
        the standard single definition and single wordplay clues - often, there are more parts! 
        Anyway, solve the clues:
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Across</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li value="1">Dance, replacing roasted heart with medium / Kobe / beef originally ingested by mother / snake = <b>MAMBA</b><br>[_s_&rarr;M]AMBA / def / MAM(B_)A / def</li>
        <li value="6">Everything taking to / a cost / at endless polls = <b>ATOLL</b><br>A(TO)LL / A+TOLL / AT+_OLL_</li>
        <li value="7">Prime / brew of ether / ash conceals start of hidden / letter count of this puzzle's answer = <b>THREE</b><br>def / THREE* / T(H_)REE / def</li>
        <li value="8">Confused shore / firefighter / uncovered western cresol after first hiding / parts of those remains = <b>HOSER</b><br>HOSER* / def / H_+_OSER_&lt; / hidden (tHOSE Remains)</li>
        <li value="9">Didn't pay attention to / beginning signs, jumped uncentered, / was knocked out / and metaphorically died = <b>SLEPT</b><br>def / S_+LE(-a)PT / def / def</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <b>Down</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li value="1">Misguided principal at high school / oddly meant this / turned fake over time = <b>MATHS</b><br>M_+AT+HS / M_A_T_H_S / MA(T)HS&lt; (fake=sham rev.)</li>
        <li value="2">Massachusetts town / playwright Fugard / is outspoken jerk with a lisp = <b>ATHOL</b><br>def / def / ATHOL ("asshole" homophone, with a lisp)</li>
        <li value="3">Piece detailed / the next step to this puzzle: / British inspector = <b>MORSE</b><br>MORSE[-l] / def / def</li>
        <li value="4">Censorship: / above-average cover up = <b>BLEEP</b><br>def / B + LEEP&lt;</li>
        <li value="5">Drunkenly alter / notification / (wary / retweet) after beer = <b>ALERT</b><br>ALERT* / def / def / ALE+RT</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>These fit into a 5&times;5 word square (and can be used to help get the trickier clues) as follows:</p>
    
    <table id="grid">
    <tr><td>M</td><td>A</td><td>M</td><td>B</td><td>A</td></tr>
    <tr><td>A</td><td>T</td><td>O</td><td>L</td><td>L</td></tr>
    <tr><td>T</td><td>H</td><td>R</td><td>E</td><td>E</td></tr>
    <tr><td>H</td><td>O</td><td>S</td><td>E</td><td>R</td></tr>
    <tr><td>S</td><td>L</td><td>E</td><td>P</td><td>T</td></tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>One of the clues suggests what to do next: Morse code. Wordplays tend to be longer than 
        definitions, so they should be assigned dashes (although if you do the other direction, 
        .-.- turns out not to be valid English Morse). Thus, we get:</p>
    
        <b>Across:</b><br>
        MAMBA = -.-. = C<br>
        ATOLL = --- = O<br>
        THREE = .--. = P<br>
        HOSER = -.-- = Y<br>
        SLEPT = .-.. = L<br><br>
        
        <b>Down:</b><br>
        MATHS = --- = O<br>
        ATHOL = ..- = U<br>
        MORSE = -.. = D<br>
        BLEEP = .- = A<br>
        ALERT = -..- = X<br>
    
    <p>Using the final enumeration, we get COPY LOUD AX. This is another cryptic clue with enumeration provided as 3, resolving to the answer "copy" = F+AX = <span class="answer">FAX</span>.</p>

<h2>Authorâ€™s Notes</h2>
    This puzzle was initially inspired by thinking about how double definitions 
    were sometimes naturally extended to greater numbers of definitions (triple definitions, even octuple definitions) in standard cryptics, so I thought that maybe having multiple wordplays would be fun too. 
    With long and short parts, Morse seemed like a natural encoding scheme and thus this puzzle concept was born.
