Like MacGregor itself, this meta has two components. The video given in the puzzle shows a popular YouTube video titled “The Incredible Giraffe Puzzle”. While the puzzle in that video seems almost impossible, it can in fact be solved by simply attaching the two pieces together. Similarly, this metapuzzle can be solved by attaching the two component answers together to form the final answer, <span class="answer">WHITE FANG</span>.
