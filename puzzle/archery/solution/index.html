<p>This event took place Saturday 10-11am EST.
Teams were told to send any number of participants who like "shapes".
Once the event started, teams were directed to enter the
Projection Device and follow their group leaders to the classroom
26-100.</p>

<p>Each group was split up into guessers and cluers. The cluers
would try to communicate a clue phrase to the guessers by making
shapes and pictorial representations through the Projection Device.
The cluers can see the guesses and change their strategy depending
on how far off the guesses are. After around 10 minutes,
the moderator may start giving some
letters of the clue phrase until the guessers get the answer.
After each round, people change who the guessers and the cluers are.</p>
