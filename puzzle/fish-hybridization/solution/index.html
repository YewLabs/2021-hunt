<p>This is a puzzle about Animal Crossing: New Horizons, specifically the “capture quotes” (there isn’t an official name for them) that the player character says when they catch a fish, which are specific to the fish species. This is clued by the title and flavortext, which includes “hybridization” a.k.a. “crossing” of “fish”, which are a kind of animal, and “2020” to specify the version.</p>

<p>Each clue references the <a href="https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Catch_quote#In_New_Horizons">capture quotes</a> of two fish, which have the same number of letters. Overlap the two fish names and take the matching letter to extract the answer, <span class="answer">SEA BREAM</span>, another kind of fish (albeit not one in Animal Crossing).</p>

<h2>Author’s Notes</h2>
	<p>Lots of testsolvers who hadn’t played Animal Crossing were able to realize that the puzzle was about it, but not that the puzzle was about capture quotes. It’s not that obvious that capture quotes exist from cursory internet research, but (at least in my head) it should be much more obvious to anybody who has played the game and gets repeatedly confronted with the terrible puns whenever they catch a fish. So I hope this puzzle somewhat rewarded people who had actually played Animal Crossing or who decided to watch videos to understand how catching fish worked more deeply. (And for those of you who did this puzzle without having played Animal Crossing, I hope you got a kick out of learning about these terrible puns.)</p>
