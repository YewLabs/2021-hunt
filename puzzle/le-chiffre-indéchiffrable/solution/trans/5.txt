[Verse 1]
Barry Dalida
What's your favorite type of yoghurt?
Dice can go even further
Girl, you're so female tonight
Good morning Britain
Square square cannot be like you
I'm right

[Verse 2]
Daril
Space is suffering from anxiety
If you remember, I will not be
Dysrythmia
Close the eggs
My face fell off when I heard my voice
I know you

[Chorus]
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
What do you do?

[Verse 3]
Hey yummy yummy
I know the weather is bad
But I only trust girls
Someday I'll burn my house down with these smokes
Do not be angry
We know we will never survive
Is the m–µdiator good?

[Verse 4]
Forced Aloha
But let me tell you - this is a bad place
But if all the songs are fast, I will write them
Pants
I'm still there
I'm not in love with you
I own you

[Chorus]
Oh, so that's what worries me?
Oh, so that's what worries me?
Oh, so that's what worries me?
Oh, so that's what worries me?
What are you doing?

[Bridge]
Obviously, death was dead
But bananas and carrots on two planes
And if they don't make a mistake, they'll kidnap you
All the heads of our friends were concerned
The joke is funny
Some of them committed sexual immorality
Dolly, I promise
Let's eat him
The world is nothing, not always
My dog is a dog

[Verse 5]
Long live Deria
You're mediocre, I will not miss you
The game does not open for two years
By Bill Peter
He knows everything about you
I could not do what I wanted
Dalish said he failed
This is all you

[Chorus]
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
What do you do?

[Outro]
Oh, wow
Oh, wow
Yes!
