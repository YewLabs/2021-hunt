[Verse 1]
I can not get a dog
And you are not there
Scope okay if do not know
Prayer is cheesy
Yes, I know I'm pregnant
I can't today, and more
I always have fits and illnesses
Snow before you go

[Chorus]
God will help the wicked
Death of humanity
Look at the kindness
Is there any earth?
I saved myself and saved them
Serious gravity is happening
God helps the sheep
Vienna does not want it

[Verse 2]
I want an invoice
You can go
But I know a lot
I'm rich
Why is my husband?
I'm annoying
Just one thought
Who is God?

[Outro]
It is bread
Cake active cocoa...
