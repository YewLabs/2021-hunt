[Verse 1]
Ah fire ah
I'm really sorry
I can hear you, but I can't hear you
Some people have difficulty getting medication
The whole day I was lying in bed all day
I hope you don't care if I insult you, ah fire ah
Ah fire ah

You're are weak
You spat in my ear.
But I don't care, I don't care.
I'm afraid of horses in Finland.
I am a flying person, entertaining and free.
Sorry, this is a secret service, but I want you to sing.
I am a police officer and I do not need anything new.
I am afraid of who I am when I am alive.

[Chorus 1]
Fight with strangers.
Fight with strangers.
Fight with strangers.
Oops!
Oh no, the saucepan!

[Verse 2]
What does the kitchen want?
That's religion, am I right?
The mine-like bombs and the salads.
I have no idea where I want to be.
I was smoking too much every day.
Do you think your role is important ...

[Chorus 2]
Fight with strangers.
Fight with strangers.
Fight with strangers.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Wow.
You don't like it.
Tony?
What does it mean?
Why did you tell him that?
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
Oh, oh, get rich.
What a waste.
Oh man.
Yikes!
Too bad!

Return.
TÄ§alixni myself.
O what should I do?
Pineapple? (Wow).
