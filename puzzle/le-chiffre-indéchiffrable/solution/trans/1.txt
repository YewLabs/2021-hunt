[Verse 1]
I'm not in love with my legs
You shine like salt and this is me
Total devotion, I guess
You can't have friends any more
I want to know what they think
Roger that

[Chorus 1]
I do not want to pay
I'll never do that again
Don't lean on the table
You are not allowed to cry
Boomerang
Don't let me hurt the camels

[Verse 2]
Self was seasoned, clothes are shown
You have heart disease but I can't tell
We all know what works indoors and out
We have to play with carrots

If you love love
Don't speak impulsively

[Chorus 2]
I do not want to pay
I'll never do that again
Don't lean on the table
You are not allowed to cry
Boomerang
Don't let me hurt the camels

[Chorus 3]
I'm not a goat
I do not want to be what I am
Far from fleeing and yitewewoteli
There are no beds
Boomerang
Be alone wait for Lisa

(Hannah)
(Help me)
Never give up, never give up
I will never die

[Chorus 4]
I do not want to pay
I'll never do that again
Don't lean on the table
You are not allowed to cry
Boomerang
Don't let me hurt the camels
