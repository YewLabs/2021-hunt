<p>In each image, something has been crossed out.</p>

<p>
    Row one: XX (roman numeral for twenty), Jamie Foxx, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_XXXXX!">Sexual XXXXX!</a><br>
    Row two: XX (chromosomes), XXXX (from Discworld)<br>
    Row three: XXXXX (acromantula danger rating)<br>
    Row four: T.J. Maxx, XXXXXXXXXXXX (twelve strikes in bowling)<br>
    Row five: Dos Equis (XX), Exxon, Rexxar, the flag of Amsterdam (XXX)<br>
</p>

<p>Clearly, the number of consecutive Xs in each picture is relevant. But what do we do with them? Well, the puzzle is about Xs, and X means multiply, so we multiply them together.</p>

<p>
    2 x 2 x 5 = 20 = T<br>
    2 x 4 = 8 = H<br>
    5 = 5 = E<br>
    2 x 12 = 24 = X<br>
    2 x 2 x 2 x 3 = 24 = X<br>
</p>

<p>So the answer to the puzzle is, fittingly enough, <span class="answer">THE XX</span>.</p>
