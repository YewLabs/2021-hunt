<p>
  The body of this puzzle is blank, but someone seems to have called in a bunch of wrong answers. Curiously, the submissions span twenty years—but all of them happen in mid-January, specifically on the Saturday before Martin Luther King Jr. Day. That&rsquo;s because each submission is actually the correct answer to a puzzle from that year&rsquo;s Mystery Hunt. As the flavortext indicates, we need to figure out the reason they are now marked as incorrect.
</p>

<p>
  The reason can be found by tracking down the solution writeups for the puzzles. Each answer comes from a cluephrase in its original puzzle, which has become out of date in some way during the intervening years. We need to find an updated answer that works for the same cluephrase in the present day. The flavortext also notes that this puzzle has no rate limiting on guesses, in order to let us confirm subanswers along the way.

<h2>Author’s Notes</h2>

<p>
  The original concept for this puzzle had a last step where you would phone us, and we would pretend you were the team running the hunt and we were calling in LATE ONSET. We would get to do our sound effects, and you would get the answer along with a little taste of the old-style answer callbacks. Under the circumstances, we cut it. But I think it would have been cool.

<p>Among the answers dropped from this puzzle were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1997, <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/1997/puzzle28solution.html">Puzzle 28</a>: The solution page, which was written several years afterward when the hunt was archived, actually notes that radio station WRIT had changed its callsign to WVCD during that time.</li>
  <li>2003, <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/2003/www.acme-corp.com/solutions/second-game.html">Second Game</a>: Frederik Pohl won another Hugo award in 2010 &mdash; it&rsquo;s for Best Fan Writer, so he was credited as himself.</li>
  <li>2007, <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/2007/puzzles/logical_digits/answer/">Logical Digits</a>: The cluephrase involves looking up a hostname on MIT&rsquo;s network from the IP address. However, we believe the IP was in the part of the 18 block that MIT sold off, and thus is no longer accessible.</li>
  <li>2009, <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/2009/puzzles/space_ghosts_coast_to_coast/SOLUTION/">Space Ghosts, Coast to Coast</a>: Ghostbusters: Afterlife, scheduled for release in 2021, actually stars three new members of the Spengler family! We don&rsquo;t know yet if any of them are Ghostbusters, though.</li>
  <li>2016, <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/2016/puzzle/missing_the_mark/solution/">Missing the Mark</a>: Lauren Faust has a new series that ends in &ldquo;Girls&rdquo;: it&rsquo;s <em>DC Super Hero Girls</em>. But there&rsquo;s no obvious way to add D to that phrase. (My proposal of Roman numeral arithmetic, resulting in MC SUPER HERO, was shot down by testsolvers.)
</ul>
What does the title mean? It&rsquo;s what happens when a <em>clue frays</em>.
