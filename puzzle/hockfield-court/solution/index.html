The puzzle consists of five clues whose answers (which are in alphabetical order) are ATLAS, EAST, EDEN, HDTV, and WELSH.

A friend and I once had a long argument about which of the five paths through Hockfield Court is traversed the most often. I hope this author's note has convinced you to think about this important question too.
