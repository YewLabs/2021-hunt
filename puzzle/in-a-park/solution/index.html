<p>This puzzle is an in-person runaround in one of twenty or so parks in different cities. First, we must choose a park to visit from the list, and go there. Once we're in one of the parks (let's use <b>Fort Greene Park</b> as an example), we look the name of the park up in the huge list. That gives us a clue with a three word answer. In this case, the answer is <b>SPLENDOR ANOTHER CENTURY</b>.</p>

<img width='100%' src='{{sproot}}path.png'>

<p>Now, we look to the image in the puzzle that points to the path splitting in three. We can look up each of the three words in our answer in the list to get another clue. Each clue gives an answer that we can look up in the list again. We repeat this process three times, following the paths in the image. The third clue in each chain will resolve to a clue that does not appear to be about the park we are in:</p>

<br>
<b>X</b>: What sport’s world record is exactly the elevation gain of the Modelo Trail?<br>
<b>A</b>: What used to be mined in the place that is a 92.5 mile bus ride into a park?<br>
<b>4</b>: Take the price of Yellowstone in National Parks Monopoly, and multiply by the number of counties Yellowstone spans. Add the number of US National Parks that had more than 2.5 million visitors in 2019.
<br>

<p>These clues are about US National Parks. Their answers, which fit in the red blanks in the image, are respectively <b>MEN'S JAVELIN</b>, <b>GOLD</b> and <b>2012</b>. The winner of the gold medal in the Men's Javelin in the 2012 Olympics was <span class="answer">Keshorn Walcott</span>, who fits the enumeration in the image.</p>

<h2>Authors’ Notes</h2>

We thought it wouldn't truly be a Mystery Hunt without a real runaround puzzle. We hope any runaround fans liked this one!
<p>
In our hunt registration, we asked teams where in the world they would be solving from, and we aimed to have at least one park in every popular area. We sought out friends and friends-of-friends to help us write clues in some places where none of our teammates live.
