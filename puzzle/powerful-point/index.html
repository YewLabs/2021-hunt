<div class="fourthwall">Note: The puzzle is a .ppsx file that works best in Microsoft PowerPoint 2016 or later. MIT students should be able to obtain a copy for free. The free iOS app can also open the puzzle properly. Other equivalent software, such as LibreOffice, Keynote, Google Slides, PowerPoint for the web, or the Android PowerPoint app will make solving significantly harder. The puzzle may also have unintended behavior in earlier versions of PowerPoint.</div>
