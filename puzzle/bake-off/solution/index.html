<p>The instructions comprise a very detailed recipe for sugar cookies baked from scratch (to be shaped like the team’s emoji). The “simplified” recipe is:</p>

<li>Cream the butter and sugar in a large bowl.</li>
<li>Mix in the vanilla and the egg.</li>
<li>Mix the remaining dry ingredients in a medium bowl, then add to the wet.</li>
<li>Lightly grease a baking sheet or line it with parchment paper. Separate the dough and shape it on the baking sheet.</li>

<p>The last step of the recipe asks us to call HQ once our bake is ready. During the hunt, teams that did this were asked to show off their cookies and then asked to identify the emoji from other teams’ cookies in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSfbLJpoArE9mnaTsmL58uNqCaXxcccPKWHBXR2EF67GoA0LEkoPXnYojCA12wq2xH_7MOPaknZpff_/pub">gallery</a>. After completing this task, teams were given the answer, <span class="answer">CILANTRO</span>.</p>
