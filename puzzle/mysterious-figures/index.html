        <td>I'm not really a Queen kinda person, you know? I don't take direction from anyone else, I'm more of a loner.
            I was gonna feature Michael Jackson but then things didn't work out, maybe because I'm such a disaster all
            the time. My row adds up to twice my column.</td>
        <td>I live in Highbury and I...ooh I need to sit down, feeling faint. I always wear this calculator watch. Some
            people think I'm a food. Exactly two of my neighbors' numbers match my number.</td>
        <td>i likE counting and giving away monEy. my numbEr is a pErfEct squarE.</td>

                died once, grrr</span>. I danced for you,
            in fact. My horizontal neighbors' numbers add to my number. <span class="small">Why do they have to do that?
                grrr.</span></td>

            I have the biggest number in this column.</td>

        <td>Oh my gosh. I absolutely love a sparkly kitchen. Give me more sponges. A spray bottle. I've got this. Have
            you seen the bathrooms? The tiles are so pearly white. The hallways? Give me a broom. I've got a duster. A
            mop. I will buff everything until it glows radiant! My number is the number of distinct numbers my neighbors
            have. That is to say, the count of different numbers had by my neighbors? That's my number.</td>
        <td>What do you mean, that's none of my business? I've been popular for fifty years and I can brew faster than
            anyone. My number is the mean of my two horizontal neighbors' numbers.</td>
        <td>I just wanna run a pizzeria, all this big city nonsense is really scary! It's changed surprisingly little in
            the 66 years since I was first here in 1936. Pickpockets, reporters, what if I miss the subway, what if
            everyone's just trying to trick me! My number is prime.</td>
        <td>You say I was on TV for five years in the sixties? I don't remember that. You say I belong to Wilbur? I
            don't remember that either. Exactly three of my neighbors form an arithmetic sequence, and exactly one of my
            neighbors is twice me. At least I remember that much.</td>
        <td>Balderdash. I founded a famous group of four. Poppycock! My number plus my neighbor to the right's number is
            my neighbor below's number. Flummery, wouldn't you say?</td>
        <td>I'd like to tell you about some Australian beer, but I'd have to be reasonable in order to do that, and
            running around and acting like a child is more fun. My number properly divides the difference between my
            right and top neighbors' numbers. Boop!</td>
        <td>You ask about <i>CLANG</i> Batman? Yeah, I fight him sometimes. <i>SPLAT</i> Do you think it's warm in here?
            <i>BANG</i> My number is the largest proper divisor of the sum of the entire grid. <i>CRASH</i></td>

    <tr>
        <td>Listen, I've got a very specific recipe, and it's important that you follow it exactly. Not too many
            peanuts, not too few. My number is the number of neighbors I have, no more, no less.</td>
        <td>I swear, no matter how buff you may think I look, I didn't kill the guy in the middle of row 1. There are
            the same number of my number and my lower neighbor's number in the grid.</td>
        <td>Sorry, can't talk now, gotta go do some evil before I change back. By the way, my number divides all my
            neighbors' numbers.</td>
        <td>I've always been admired for what I've done for other people. Sure, I may not be the best parent, but I am a
            super member of society - I always do the right thing.
            My number is the difference between one of my neighbors' numbers and the sum of the other two neighbors'
            numbers.</td>
        <td>I always get picked last; it happens so often that I'm afraid I'm going to melt from being out here so long.
            My number is tied with one other person's number to be the biggest number in the grid. Figures, my draft
            pick number is always high.</td>
        <td>Do you wanna go for a trip? I never really leave this place, too busy running my restaurant. Maybe we could
            go backpacking in the wilderness, that would be both cheap and exciting! My upper neighbor's number raised
            to the power of my number is my left neighbor's number.</td>
        <td>They always tell me I've done it again, but I can't even see what it is. I've had such a successful
            television career, but I can't help but want even more. I have the sum of all my neighbors' numbers.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>They call me number 122, but that's much bigger than my number. My number is the difference between one of
            my neighbors' numbers and the sum of the other two neighbors' numbers. Would you like to join my fraternity?
        </td>
        <td>Welcome to the real world. I'm just an average guy, but people always say I'm not nice. When written out,
            the number of letters in my number is the number of my right
            neighbor. </td>
        <td>I was a stay-at-home dad before it was cool. Isn't that wonderful? I think it's astounding.
            My three neighbors' numbers sum to 11. Isn't that incredible?</td>
        <td class="title">Mysterious Figures</td>
        <td>Hehehehe I have lots hehehe of money and I hehehehe love games hehehe of chance. They hehe used to call
            me &ldquo;Uncle&rdquo; hehehe but not anymore I hehehehe guess. I'm hehehe the only one in the grid with
            this hehehe
            number. Will you stop now?</td>
        <td>They always say no more me. Well I think it's nice to have someone pleasant in the world for a change. Get
            it? Hahaha. By the way, my number is perfect.</td>
        <td>Everyone knows the postseason is when it counts, and I've taken that to heart on all my teams. Gotta stay
            chill, like a cucumber, when the pressure is on. My number appears exactly twice in my row and exactly twice
            in my column.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Rah rah rah! In some ways, I look a lot like the guy two cells to the right. I have quite an improbable
            history, but I'm always high-spirited. My upper and lower neighbors' numbers sum to my right-hand neighbor's
            number. Rah rah rah!</td>
        <td>Maybe it's because I wear a monocle always, or because of my strange shape, but I'm always running into
            everyone. I've been around over a hundred years. No relation to the guy to my right. I have the only odd
            number in my row.</td>
        <td>I don't eat very much; I have to maintain my trim Hollywoo figure! My number has more holes than any of my
            neighbors' numbers.</td>
        <td>I was replaced in 2001 by my Xtra sibling. Maybe it was because I'm always stepping on things or knocking
            them over. But even though I've been replaced, you should still care about me. I was born in Waco, TX. My
            number is the number of neighbors I have who have numbers less than three.</td>
        <td>I like to sit on the couch all day. Sometimes I change up my shoes or eyes. But sometimes I can't be
            bothered at all to do anything. My number divides my neighbor to the top's number.</td>
        <td>I may never say the correct thing, but everyone knows I'm the one you should marry. My number is the number
            of times my right neighbor's number appears in this row.</td>
        <td style="font-family: 'puzzle'; font-size: 7px;">I AM IN CHARGE OF A HACKTIVIST ORGANIZATION. MY NUMBER IS THE

            you. My four neighbors' numbers' product is 60.</td>
        <td>Hmph, this new job in Washington sucks. Everyone else in my row have numbers that add up to 21.</td>
        <td>Hmmm, oh yess, I was just thinking about, well, you know, having nice brown fur, a long trunk. Maybe I'm
            wandering through the streets. Oh, what if my best friend was a giant bird? Wouldn't that be nice? My
            neighbors' numbers' harmonic mean is 15/7. It's such a wonderful number :)</td>
        <td>I live in Hanseong and I'm an activist. I never do anything wrong, ever. My number has a difference of one
